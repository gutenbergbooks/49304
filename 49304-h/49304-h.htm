<p class="drop-cap">THIS STORY details the experiences
of a sensitive boy who, in a
moment of revolt, flees from the oppression
of some cruel schoolfellows into the woods,
where he meets Nature, who takes him
round the world and shows to him her
kingdom of fur and feather. The child is
introduced to all manner of beasts and
birds, and learns valuable lessons of kindness
and toleration, while at the same
time the facts of natural history are not
distorted to serve the purpose of a story.
Everything is true to facts, so far as they
are known from observation and from
the best authorities.</p>

<p>The Illustrations are of quite unusual
merit, and will establish the claims of this
talented artist to a place amongst the best
English interpreters of animal life.</p>

<h2><i>Preface to the New Edition</i></h2>

<div class="width146">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-i.png" width="146" height="150" alt="decorative letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IN a book of this kind nothing more
will be expected than an outline
sketch of some phases of the life
lived by the prehistoric dwellers
in our land. The known facts are
few; yet there must have been, even in those
far-away times, well-defined differences of habit
and custom due to local circumstances; so that
details more or less true of one tribe or group
would possibly be quite untrue of others.</p>

<p>But, for all that, there are various conclusions
upon which the learned may be considered to be
in agreement; and, working from these and from
the descriptions of primitive life in our own times,
there is brought within our reach the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of constructing a picture of man in early Britain
which, without leaving the lines of reasonable
conjecture, need be neither meagre nor misleading.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made here to introduce
only descriptions which can in some degree be
vouched for; and as much of such authenticated
detail as possible has been included. Some licence
has been taken in bringing together events which
in nature were, no doubt, separated by long intervals
of time and space; in suggesting, for instance,
that a man of the newer stone age might have heard
some vague tradition of the makers of the old stone
weapons, and yet, in his lifetime, have witnessed
the incoming of the first weapons of bronze: yet,
for the sake of picturesqueness, such licence may
be considered to be not only permissible but, in
a book with the purpose of this, actually desirable.</p>

<p>When first it was suggested to the writer that
he should undertake this task, there was only one
detail of the necessary equipment which he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
feel to be his own&mdash;a childhood’s interest in the
subject, never forgotten. There was the recollection
of a chapter in an old lesson-book, much pored
over, with its two or three simple woodcuts showing
the skin-clad “ancient Briton” hollowing out
his log canoe, or shooting at the deer in the forest.
There was the memory of a reputed “British village,”
with its pits and mounds, situated on a distant
hill in the neighbourhood of his old home,
often talked about, but too remote to be visited.
There were recollections of a village philosopher,
an amateur bird-stuffer and collector of fossils and
antiquities, who carried in his purse and would
show a treasure beyond gold, a barbed flint arrow-head.
One he was who did not resent the companionship
of an inquisitive little boy, but took him
fishing and taught him something of the old
country lore.</p>

<p>The road into fairyland lay open before that
boy in his childhood. With home-made bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
arrows he stalked the deer on the open hill-side,
or, armed with the deadly besom-stake for spear,
tracked the wild boar to his lair among the whins.
A running stream bounding the distant fields was
for him a river to be forded with caution; the
woodland pool was a forest lake, deep and mysterious;
the grove of oaks on the hill-side was a woodland,
and the more distant woods a forest vast and
impenetrable.</p>

<p>And the skin-clad hunters of the bygone time
peopled those hills and woods. The rabbits became
red-deer, the hovering kestrel a flapping eagle, a
chance fox galloping over the hill a ravening wolf,
and the shy badger (only that one could never get
more than the hearsay of him) a fierce old wild-boar.
Then there were huts to be built, fires kindled,
and weapons fashioned, marksmanship to be practised,
hunting expeditions to be carried out, and
ruthless warfare waged with unfriendly tribes.</p>

<p>Thus when the writer began the welcome task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of setting down something about the life of a time
so remote that only the indestructible fragments of
its framework are now to be recovered, he had for
his guidance these memories of childish games
and wonderings; games that were never played out,
and wonderings that have never been satisfied. And
it was his hope that others, whether or not situated
as fortunately as he once was, might perhaps catch
a hint of the joy of playing the old games and
following the old ways of life out-of-doors, as our
forefathers followed them in the days before history.
We have not all forgotten them yet.</p>

<p>A glance at the Contents will show that the
chapters fall into two groups; those headed <em>The Story
of Tig</em>, which are meant to be a story and nothing
more; and those headed <em>Dick and his Friends</em>,
which aim at explaining parts of the story and
giving further details and comments from the standpoint
of a later time. For anyone who finds these
chapters dull, nothing is easier than to skip them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>A longish list might be made of the various
books which have been read or consulted in the
preparation of these chapters. They are all well-known
standard books, such as would be readily
found by anyone who might wish to follow the
subject further. This edition includes six chapters
that are new&mdash;numbers six, nine, and fifteen to
eighteen&mdash;besides various paragraphs and oddments
scattered throughout the book; the chapter-headings
have been altered in most instances, and
the illustrations are nearly all new.</p>

<p>The author wishes to offer his sincere thanks
to Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., who generously
consented to look over the proofs of the
original book; and to Professor J. J. Findlay and
Miss Maria E. Findlay for their invaluable help
and kindly encouragement.</p>

<div class="width146">

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">I KNOW a boy called Dick. He is
nine, and he lives near London. Last
spring Dick’s father and mother
moved house. All their furniture
and things were taken in the vans,
and Dick and his father and mother went in a cab.</p>

<p>When they got to the house, Dick ran in at once
to explore. It was not really a new house, because
people had lived in it before; but Dick was disappointed
to find it very much the same as the house
they had just left. There was the drawing-room on
one side of the hall and the dining-room on the
other, and all the rooms upstairs, and the bath-room,
and the box-room, just the same as in their other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
house; and there was a garden with walls round the
three sides, very like their last one. And Dick was
sorry that there was nothing new to see. So he said
to his father that he did not like the new house
because it was just like the old one. But his father
said: “You must not grumble at that. Lots of houses
are very much alike, of course. There are so many
people in these days who want the same sort of
house built for them.”</p>

<p>That summer Dick went to pay a visit to his
uncle, a long way off in the country. Dick’s uncle
lived in a very old house; part of it was more than
four hundred years old, and Dick had never been in
such an old house in his life. His uncle took him all
round it, and showed him many strange things. The
oldest part of the house was a square tower with
very thick walls and long, very narrow windows.
Dick’s uncle told him that the windows were made
like slits so that the men inside the tower could shoot
their arrows out at their enemies; while the enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
would find it very hard to shoot their arrows in and
hit the men inside. And he said, also, that in the old
days before people could make glass for windows, it
was better to have little windows than big ones in
very cold weather.</p>

<p>And Dick’s uncle took him to the top of the
tower and showed him the remains of an open fireplace,
in which the men of the tower used to light
a beacon fire to give the alarm to people in the villages
and towns when enemies were coming.</p>

<p>And outside the tower he showed him part of a
deep ditch, and told him that once this ditch went
right round the house and was called a moat, only
that now it was nearly all filled up with earth and
stones. But at one time it was always full of water,
so that no one could get at the tower without crossing
the moat. And the people in the tower used to
let down a bridge, called the drawbridge, because
it was drawn up and down by means of chains. So
that when they or their friends wanted to go out or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
come in, the drawbridge used to be let down for
them, and pulled up afterwards.</p>

<p>And Dick’s uncle told him that all these things
used to be done to make houses safe to live in, because
once upon a time long ago there were a great many
thieves and robbers in the land, and there were no
policemen to keep them in order; also that the
people used to fight among themselves a great deal;
and his uncle showed him some old pieces of armour,
and a helmet and a battle-axe and some swords,
such as the knights and men-at-arms used in battle
long ago.</p>

<p>Dick’s uncle’s name was Uncle John. He was very
much pleased to see that Dick liked his old house and
his old swords and armour; but he said: “I know
where there are the remains of some houses a very
great deal older than mine. If you would like to see
them, we will go for a walk to-morrow and try to
find them.”</p>

<p>The next day they set out for their walk&mdash;Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and his uncle John and a collie and two terriers&mdash;and
Uncle John said: “We will call for Joe first.”</p>

<p>“Is Joe a dog?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said his uncle; “Joe is a boy. He is nine,
like you, and he lives in the house with the green
gate.”</p>

<p>But Joe said he was afraid he could not come for
a walk, because his cousin David had come to spend
the holidays with him, and they had made a plan to
go fishing. So Uncle John invited David, too, and
they all set off together.</p>

<p>After they had gone about a mile along the lane,
they came to a heath. It was a large open heath on
the top of a hill, looking down a slope into a valley.
The slope of the hill was covered with bushes, and
there were trees in little groups here and there. The
hills beyond were mostly covered with woods, and
there was a stream in the valley down below. Uncle
John led the way until they came to a flattish place
on the hill-side. Then he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now close to us here is a place where people
lived long ago, before ever they could build towers
or houses at all. Who can find where these old-time
people lived?”</p>

<p>And the boys all searched round among the
bushes and the rocks; and after a while Joe called
out: “Was it here?”</p>

<p>Uncle John went to look, and he laughed at Joe.
For what he had found was a little rough shed that
the rabbit-catchers had put up.</p>

<p>Then Dick called out. He had gone further down
the hill, and had come upon an old limekiln with a
little opening, like a doorway, at the bottom
of it.</p>

<p>But Uncle John said: “No, I don’t think that
the limekiln is even half as old as my house. What
we are looking for is something not built with
stones and without walls of any sort.”</p>

<p>Then David ran away, and he shouted out; and
when they went to where he was, they found him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
standing in a sort of pit dug in the ground, about
the depth that David could stand in up to his shoulders,
and about twice as wide across as Uncle John’s
walking-stick could measure.</p>

<p>And Uncle John said: “Yes, that is one place;
but, if you look about, you will find several more.”</p>

<p>So the boys hunted about, and they found nine
or ten more of the pits; and then they came back
to where Uncle John was sitting and asked him to
tell them about these old dwellings. But he said
they must wait a little while, because he had something
else for them to see first.</p>

<p>As they walked homeward over the heath, they
came to a place where the cart-tracks went down
to the sand-pits, and the way was bare and rough.
And Uncle John said: “Now which of you boys
has got eyes in his head? Within a dozen yards
of where we are standing I have dropped something
which once belonged to one of the men of the pit-dwellings.
Sixpence for the boy who finds it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they all began to hunt round, but no one
could find anything. So Uncle John said: “It is
something made of flint-stone. The man to whom
it belonged used to shoot with it.” And he kept on
saying, while they were looking about: “Dick is
hot” or “Joe is warm,” just as if they were playing
at Hide the Thimble.</p>

<p>At last Joe called out, “I’ve got it!” and he came
running up with an arrow-head chipped out of
grey flint; and the others crowded round to look at
it. And Uncle John showed them how carefully it
had been chipped, and how sharp the point and
edges were, although it was hundreds and hundreds
of years old.</p>

<p>And he cut a strong little shoot off a hazel
tree, and shortened it, and split it at the end,
and showed them how he supposed the man who
made the arrow all that long time ago had fixed it
to its shaft.</p>

<p>Then he took out sixpence, and said to Joe, “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
you might choose, which would you rather have?
The sixpence or the arrow-head?”</p>

<p>And Joe said, “The arrow-head, ever so much
rather!”</p>

<p>But Uncle John said, “You mayn’t choose now,
so take your sixpence. But I’ll tell you what: if you
three boys would like to know more about the pit-dwelling
people, and about their houses, and how
they hunted and all that, I have a book at home in
which there is a lot about these things; and I think
it would be a good way of filling up some of your
spare time these holidays if we were to have some
reading out of the book now and then. You might
try your hands at building a hut, to see if you could
do it as well as the pit-dwelling people did. And
you might make some bows and arrows, and even
have a try at chipping out flint arrow-heads. We
might have a shooting match with the bows and
arrows, with another sixpence for the prize. Or,
better still, we might have for a prize this flint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
arrow-head of mine that Joe is so fond of; and
give it to the boy who knows most about what we
have been reading, when we come to the end of
the holidays.”</p>

<p>They all agreed that that would be rather a good
way of amusing themselves, if the book were interesting.
But by the time they got home it was
too late to begin; so the reading had to be put off
until the next day.</p>

<p>On the next day Joe and David went up to Uncle
John’s house. As it was a wet afternoon they sat
indoors. On the table there was a large brown book;
and as soon as they had settled themselves, Uncle
John took up the book and began to read.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>THE STORY OF TIG: Tig’s Birthday and his
Home</i></p>

<div class="width153">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-o.png" width="153" height="150" alt="decorative letter O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">ONCE upon a time, a very long time
ago, there was a boy called Tig.
When the story begins, Tig was
only a baby; he was four, or nearly
four. To tell the truth, he did not
quite know when his birthday was. He did not
have a proper birthday every year. Nobody kept
birthdays when Tig was little, because people had
not any names for the months, as we have now.</p>

<p>They talked about the hot-time and the cold-time,
two times instead of four seasons; and if
you could have spoken their language, and had
asked Gofa, Tig’s mother, when Tig’s birthday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was, she would have said, “One day in the cold-time.”</p>

<p>When Tig was born, he lived first of all in a little
house which had only one room in it. It was rather
like a cellar, because it was dug out of the ground.</p>

<p>There were no windows in the house. There was
only one doorway, and it was a hole, like the mouth
of a burrow; and Tig’s father and mother, and any
of their friends who came to visit them, had to crawl
in and out on all-fours. At night, when the family
were all inside, Tig’s father used to set up a big stone
against the entrance-hole. He used to say in fun
that this was to keep out the wolves and the bears.
But neither bears nor wolves had much chance to
get in, because there was a high paling of posts that
surrounded all the huts. The big door-stone was always
kept inside the hut, so that it was handy if ever
they wanted to block the doorway against anybody
during the daytime.</p>

<p>The fireplace was in the middle of the floor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
there was a hole in the roof to let the smoke out.
In the daytime the hole in the roof made a kind of
window. The roof was made of branches of trees.
These were supported on the ground by a foundation
of thick flat stones and pieces of turf, and were overlaid
with smaller branches and turves and a rough
thatch of reeds.</p>

<p>Here Tig’s father, who was called Garff, and
Gofa, Tig’s mother, lived nice and snug in the cold-time.
They had no bedsteads nor tables nor chairs
nor chests of drawers. But they had plenty of skins
of wild horses and cows and deer, and wolf-skins
and bear-skins, instead of beds and chairs; and Tig’s
own sleeping-cot was a skin of a little bear that Garff
had killed on purpose for him. Their other belongings
were of a useful sort, not large and heavy like
furniture, but such things as cooking pots, the
mealing-stone for crushing corn, and the big
wooden mortar in which grain or acorns could be
pounded into flour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In summer-time they used to find the dug-out
hut too hot to live in, and besides, they had to take
their cattle out to fresh pastures. So they, and their
friends who lived in the other huts close by, used to
pack up their skin rugs and all their other belongings,
and travel to another part of the hill country.
Some of the men used to march on in front, with their
spears and bows and arrows ready, in case they were
to meet any wild beasts. Then came the rest of the
men and the boys with the dogs, driving the cattle
along; and after them the old men and the women
and children, with more armed men to bring up the
rear. The women carried the skins and the cooking
pots and the food; and almost every one had a baby
bound on to her back. The food was carried in
baskets, and the bigger children helped to carry the
baskets. The smaller children had no loads to carry,
except their dolls and playthings which they hugged
in their arms as they walked along beside their
mothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The people left the huts and marched down the
hill. Then they crossed the river, wading into the
water at a shallow place. But the little children had
to be carried over; and Tig was carried over by his
mother every time until after he was seven.</p>

<p>The tribe used to take a whole day in travelling
to the camping-place; and when they got there
at last, they used to make a new fire, and light bonfires
in the open, and cook their supper, and sleep
in tents and booths about the fires.</p>

<p>Up on the hill-side, at the edge of the forest, where
the ground had been partly cleared, was the place of
the first summer camp. The summer huts were built
above ground, of branches of trees, wattled with
withies and twigs, and daubed with clay. Sometimes
a man had only to repair the hut that he had
lived in the summer before. But even if he had to
build a new one, it was not such hard work as to
build a winter hut. Before a man began to build his
summer hut, he picked out a tree with a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
trunk to act as the main support of his hut. He used
the tree as a centre pillar to hold up his roof-beams.
If he built his summer hut in the open, away from
the trees, he set up a pole for a roof-tree. We still
talk of living under our own roof-tree, just as those
people did long ago.</p>

<p>The fireplaces were made out-of-doors. If they
had been indoors, the huts would often have been
burned down. Probably they often were burned
down even then. So whatever cooking Tig’s mother
wanted to do in the summer camps she did at a big
fire outside the huts.</p>

<p>The winter village of dug-out huts was high up
on the hillside at the upper end of a sheltered valley,
and the summer camps were set up at different places
upon the hills, as the people moved about with their
cattle; and wherever they were, they always put up
a stockade of posts around the huts, to keep themselves
and their cattle safe from wolves and bears.</p>

<p>But besides their dwelling-places, the people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a fort, which was meant to be used only in time of
war for the tribe to retire to, if their enemies should
attack them. It was built at the top of a high hill, in
the form of a ring, with a mound of earth and
stones, and a stockade all round, and a deep ditch
outside. The fort was big enough to take in all the
people and their cattle in case of necessity; but
when Tig was a baby, it had not been used for a
long time and nobody lived in it.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">TIG’S mother was called Gofa. She
was the mistress of the house and
the housekeeper. She did not keep
any servants, but did the work
herself; she minded Tig and his
little brothers and sisters, and cooked their meals
and made clothes for Garff and all the family. Their
clothes were mostly made of skins, and Gofa always
prepared the skins for the clothes with her own
hands. To make a suit out of a deerskin was a long
business. The hide had to be dried in the open air,
and then scraped all over with flint scrapers until
all the hair was taken off. Then it was smeared with
the animal’s brains and fat, and allowed to dry again;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>and then thoroughly washed in wooden tubs and
tanned with the bark of oak-trees. When at last it
was cured and dried, it was cut into pieces and the
pieces sewn together with sinews. Gofa’s needles
were made of bone, and they were not very sharp:
she used to pierce holes in the leather with a little
bodkin made of flint stone before she could put in
the stitches. But once the stitches were made,
they held firmer than any that are sewn with
thread.</p>

<p>Whenever a deer was brought home or a cow
killed, Gofa always kept the big sinews from the
legs and dried them in the sun or under the roof of
the hut indoors.</p>

<p>Then she took a flint knife and scraped the sinew
and shredded it into threads, and drew the threads
separately through her fingers, and put them away
in a pouch made of deer-skin. This was her store of
thread.</p>

<div class="illus">

<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="471" height="700" alt="woman dressing a skin" />
<div class="caption"><p>Dressing a Skin</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>The suit that most people wore was a sark; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a sort of shirt which came down to the knees, and
was girded with a belt at the waist. This was generally
made of dressed hide; but almost every one
had besides a thicker dress for cold weather, with
the hair left on; and the richer people had these
trimmed with different sorts of fur. Some wore
cloaks besides, and caps made of skin with the
hair on.</p>

<p>When the men went hunting they wore shoes
made of hide, and leather bands wrapped round their
legs for leggings. The people let their hair grow
long; and they often used to spend much time
combing and dressing it.</p>

<p>Most people, unless they were very poor, had also
finer garments of cloth, which the women span and
wove. But cloth was much scarcer than skins, besides
being more easily worn out; and so the clothes for
everyday wear were always of dressed hides. Men
who spent a great part of their time hunting and
creeping about in the thickets of the forest, wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a suit which would turn the wet and not tear easily
among the thorns and briars.</p>

<p>Tig had his first little sark and belt when he was
seven years old&mdash;it was made of deer-skin; but he
had neither cap nor leggings; for, like all the other
children, he used to run about barefoot and bareheaded.</p>

<p>Gofa taught her children many things, but she
did not teach them to read or to write: she could
neither read nor write herself, nor could any of her
neighbours.</p>

<p>People had no books and no writing in those
times. Tig did not learn to do sums or to say
the Multiplication Table; but he did learn to count,
by saying the numbers on his fingers. However, as
it is such a long time since he lived, and as no one
ever wrote down exactly how people counted in
those days, Tig’s names for the figures are not
known for certain. But it is very likely that they
were something like this. On the fingers of one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
instead of One, Two, Three, Four, Five, he said
what sounded like</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Ahn</i>, <i>Da</i>, <i>Tree</i>, <i>Kethra</i>, <i>Kweeg</i>:</p>
</div>

<p>and then on the fingers of the other hand,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Say</i>, <i>Sect</i>, <i>Oct</i>, <i>Noi</i>, <i>Dec</i>,</p>
</div>

<p>for Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten; and that was
as far as he got in the way of counting at
first.</p>

<p>But there were many things that Tig learned
from his mother out-of-doors; for Gofa used to do
a great deal of work with the other women, preparing
the ground for corn and reaping the crops at
harvest time; and Tig used to go with his mother
to the fields, or to the river when she went to cut
osiers for making baskets, or into the woods to
gather firewood. He learned to be always on the
look-out; always to listen for every sound&mdash;even so
little a noise as the snapping of a twig; and always
to bear in mind what he was going to do in case of
sudden danger, and where he should run to for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
safety if he had to flee from a wild beast. Tig did
not know many things that most boys and girls
know in these times; but he could do one thing that
hardly any boy or girl can do nowadays&mdash;he could
move his ears backward and forward just as he
wished, when he was listening very carefully to any
slight sound in the woods.</p>

<p>Tig liked the summer-time best. It was much
better fun playing in the forest near the huts and
lying basking in the hot sun than crawling about
in the dark, smoky winter pit-hut. He used to climb
about in the trees, even when he was quite little.
While his mother was busy with her work out-of-doors,
she used to put him up into a tree and let him
play about among the branches by himself; and
sometimes she even made a sort of little crib for
him with bands of hide, and left him to sleep safe
and sound in a big oak tree. This was to keep him
out of danger from wild animals. For in those days
it was dangerous for children to be out in the open or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the woods away from the huts, because there
were often wolves or other savage beasts prowling
about.</p>

<p>But round Tig’s home there was less danger,
because the wild beasts had learned to fear men and
their weapons and their fires. But still, wolves and
bears were seen sometimes close to the village; so
the children were safer playing up in the trees than
on the ground; and they all learned to be very
good climbers.</p>

<p>From the boys with whom he played, when he
grew older, Tig learned many other useful things.
He learned to swing himself down from one branch
of a tree to a lower branch, and catch hold with his
feet; to dive without splashing, and swim under
water right across to the opposite bank of the river;
to save his breath when running, so as to last out on
a long race. He and the other boys practised shooting
with bows and arrows, which their fathers
helped them to make. And they had stone-throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
matches, too; and no one was considered to be
any good unless he could throw hard and straight
with both hands. Tig and his friends all longed to
become hunters, and their favourite game was to
play at hunting; and as they grew older, they used
to go out in parties into the woods to hunt and fish.
But they did not often bring home any game.</p>

<p class="drop-capi4">AS soon as Uncle John had finished
reading, he asked the boys if any
of them could guess why Tig’s
father’s winter hut was partly dug
out of the ground.</p>

<p>Dick thought because of wild beasts; and Joe
said: “Because it would be warmer underground.”</p>

<p>Uncle John said that those were very good reasons,
but he thought the chief reason was that in
those early times people could not build walls. They
had no tools such as masons and carpenters have
nowadays. They had no iron to make pickaxes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
saws and planes with; they had only stone axes that
were not much use for splitting or shaping beams.
And so they had to live in houses not much better
than foxes’ dens or rabbit-burrows.</p>

<p>They went to the heath next day, and looked at
the pits again. Dick and Joe were talking about the
pit-dwellings. Dick said they must have been very
damp places to live in; but Joe said no&mdash;rabbits and
foxes and badgers live in burrows underground, and
their fur is always dry. They asked Uncle John’s
opinion. He said that he thought in very wet weather
the huts would be damp, because the rain
would soak in through the roof. But as the village
was on the top of the hill, no water would lie about
the ground; and, anyway, the men probably dug
trenches to carry off the water down the hill.</p>

<p>David said he thought the huts must have been
very small; he wondered how the people managed
to live in them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle John, “they must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
small. But you see, the people who lived in them
had no furniture, and they did not mind crowding.
It is very likely, too, that they did not lie down full-length
when they went to sleep. There was no room
for that in the winter huts. They slept sitting, with
their hands clasped over their feet and their chins
on their knees. We should not find this a comfortable
position to sleep in; but it was the way they
were used to. And besides, if a man had tried lying
at full length in one of these huts, he would soon
have found his toes in the fire.</p>

<p>“Before the people learned how to build huts
they lived in caves. Why was it better to live in
huts than in caves?”</p>

<p>None of the boys could think of the answer, so
Uncle John said:&mdash;“If a man could find a cave that
was roomy and dry, it would be a pleasanter place
to live in than a dug-out hut with a leaky roof. But
if he wanted to live in a cave, he would have to go
where the cave was; though if he could build a hut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he might live wherever he pleased. In the whole of
a countryside there might not be more than two or
three caves fit to live in, so that relations and friends
could not live near to each other. But once men had
learned to build huts, whole families could live together,
and, what is more, they could build a wall
or a stockade round the huts, as we have read. There
is safety in numbers too, and in many ways it was
much more comfortable for them than living scattered
over the country in caves.”</p>

<p>The boys wished very much to build a hut. But
as it was summer-time, they thought they had
better try to build a summer hut. Besides, it would
have been too big a piece of work to dig down
four or five feet into the ground. They were a long
time before they could find a place for their hut,
because, as they said, they must pretend that it was
not one hut that they were going to build, but a
whole village of huts. They talked over with Uncle
John the things that the people had in mind when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
choosing a site for a village. They decided that,
no doubt, it must be on high ground, with a clear
view of the country round about on every side, so
that the dwellers in the village could see if their
enemies were coming to attack them. Then
they would be better able to defend themselves if
they stood above their enemies, than if their
enemies stood above them.</p>

<p>There was another reason for having the village
up on the hill rather than down in the valley, and
it was this. The valleys were thick with forests, in
which were bears and wolves, so they were dangerous
for men and cattle. But on the open hill-sides
the cattle could be driven out to feed every
day in safety; and if wolves came out of the forest,
the men could see them in the open and keep them
in check.</p>

<p>Joe said they must have water for the village,
so they must be sure of being close to a stream or
a spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle John said that water was very necessary,
of course; but that if you went to live on the top of
a hill for safety you could not expect to have water
in abundance, for there are no streams about the
tops of hills, and not often springs. However, he
said, the people managed to overcome this difficulty,
as the book would tell.</p>

<p>David wanted to know about firewood; wouldn’t
they need to be near the forest for that?</p>

<p>They certainly would want firewood, Uncle
John said, and they must always depend on having
to make many journeys to the forest to get wood.
But the ground must be cleared and kept open
round about the village, so that there might be
pasture for the cattle and ground for growing corn
and other crops.</p>

<p>At last the boys found a very good place. It was
high up, beyond a grove of oak trees, and there
was a little spring close by: they called the grove
of oak trees the forest. They had not very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tools to work with. David had a big clasp-knife
with a spring at the back, to prevent it shutting
up on his hand, and Joe had a little hatchet that
was not very sharp. But Dick wrote to his mother
in London, and his father sent him a little axe like
an Indian’s tomahawk.</p>

<p>It took them three days to build the hut. Although
the trees were Uncle John’s, he could not
let them cut down branches. But he let the woodman
bring them some cut boughs from the wood-yard.</p>

<p>This was how they built the hut. They chose
a young tree with a straight trunk. Around this
they fixed the longest and straightest of their boughs
upright in the ground. Then they cut smaller
pieces of willow and birch and hazel, and laced
them in and out of the uprights, until they had
got a wattled wall all round, except between two
of the uprights, where they left a space for the
door-way. The roof they made by tying sticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
across from the uprights to the centre tree, and
lacing these with twigs and brushwood. Then they
plastered the outside with clay and earth. They
made a door, with two light poles for the sides
and two shorter ones for the ends, tied cross-wise
at the corners, and the whole interlaced, like the
walls, with hazel shoots and willows.</p>

<p>When the hut was finished, they brought Uncle
John to see it. The boys could all get inside quite
comfortably by squeezing a little; but there was
not room for Uncle John. So, as it was a very hot
afternoon, they all sat outside under an oak tree,
and read the next chapter from the brown book.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">TIG’S father, Garff, was one of the
chief men of the village. He was
very strong and a clever hunter,
and the people used to look to him
to take the lead in the big hunting
expeditions. He was a rich man, too; but that does
not mean that he had much money, because he
had no money at all. Nobody had money in those
times: they had cattle instead, and if a man had
to pay a great deal to another man, he gave a cow
or a bullock; but if he had to pay only a little, he
gave a joint of meat, perhaps, or a skin or part of
a skin, or a basket of nuts, or a jar of corn, or a
piece of honeycomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Garff had a herd of about twenty small shaggy
cows like Welsh cattle. They used to be driven
out to feed on the pasture grounds on the hills in
the daytime with other people’s cows, and some
of the old men and boys with the dogs used to
look after them. But at sunset the cowherds drove
the cattle inside the stockade of the village for the
night, to keep them safe from wild beasts; and
then the women used to come out to milk the cows.</p>

<p>Garff used to spend most of his time hunting
in the forest. Sometimes he went alone, and sometimes
two or three of his neighbours went with
him. They were not often away from home for
more than a day or two. But now and then it happened
that they had to follow the game far afield,
and then they were absent for a longer time. They
hunted the deer mostly; but sometimes they killed
the great wild cattle and wild horses and boars.
They shot birds, too, of all kinds, and caught fish in
the lakes and streams. They used to bring home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
anything they could catch that would serve for food.
Sometimes it happened that all the hunters were
unlucky for many days, and meat became scarce.
Then the killing of a bison or a wild horse was a
great event. Everybody in the village came for a
share of the meat, and either carried it home or
made a fire and cooked it on the spot. The meat was
eaten up to the very last morsel, and the people used
even to smash the bones with pieces of stone to get
the marrow.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>The Stags</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>When Tig was a boy, the flesh of wild game
was the favourite food of most people, and it was
generally the commonest and the most plentiful.
But it is easy for us to understand that, as the people
multiplied and spread about over the country, all
kinds of wild game became scarcer. The more the
animals were hunted, the more difficult it became to
get them. So it was well that there were other things
for food. In the autumn the people used to gather
all the wild fruits they could get, and store them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
up for use in the winter&mdash;nuts and acorns and wild
apples. There were other things, too, that could not
be stored, such as pignuts and blackberries and
other sorts of berries.</p>

<p>But the best food of all was corn, of which two
kinds, wheat and barley, were grown. Corn was
nicer and more wholesome than acorns, and much
more useful, because, with care and good management,
the stock could be increased; but of the wild
fruits and nuts men could gather only what natural
supply there might be.</p>

<p>Of their corn, the people made porridge and flat
cakes of bread, first pouring the grain upon a flat
stone and rubbing and grinding it with a long bar-shaped
piece of stone, to make it mealy. Also they
pounded their corn and acorns and nuts in mortars
of wood or stone. This was the women’s work: and
it might be said that the women were the millers
and bakers, and even the butchers to the households
in those days; for whenever the men brought home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a deer or any other game, the women always came
out to skin it and cut it up and to dress the meat
for cooking.</p>

<p>The people used not always to have regular
times for meals, as we have nowadays. They generally
had a morning and an evening meal, but
otherwise, while there was food, they ate when
they were hungry, and only at the feast times did
they eat together in company. Gofa generally used
to make a bowl of porridge for breakfast, and for
supper she cooked whatever game Garff had
brought home with him; for Garff, as we have
said, was a clever hunter, and could generally provide
better food than roots and acorns for his
family.</p>

<p>There were times, of course, when everybody
had to go short. In some years, when the crops
had been scanty, food became very scarce before
the end of winter, and then the people used to
suffer greatly from hunger. At such times, men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
used to hunt longer and more keenly than during
the summer and autumn months; and if a boy
could snare a hare or catch a hedgehog, or creep up
along the bank of a pool where the wild ducks
rested, and fling a couple of stones hard among
them as they rose, he would be warmly welcomed
at home when he took in his game.</p>

<p>Of course, when food became very scarce indeed,
men killed their own cattle. But they did not do
this so long as there was wild game to be got. Some
men were not such skilful hunters as others; and so
it sometimes happened that a man would have to
kill all his cows, one after another, for food during
the cold time, and a long winter would make many
men poor. The women and children suffered terribly,
and everybody got very thin. We sometimes
say nowadays that the spring is a trying time to
live through; but it was very much harder when
there were no shops where food could be bought, all
the year round alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The dogs had a bad time, too: and they used to
scratch up buried bones and gnaw them over again,
till they had gnawed away all the softer parts.
Everybody longed for the summer and the time of
plenty again; and there were always great rejoicings
when the crops were ripe, and the time came
to get in the harvest.</p>

<p>Before he was seven years old, Tig had learned in
many ways to be useful to his mother. He used to
go with her to the field and pull weeds out of the
corn, or to the woods and help her to gather dry
sticks and fir cones for fuel; and when she went to
milk the cows, Tig went too and carried one of the
milk jars; so he always earned his supper.</p>

<p>There was one thing Tig never tasted: he never
had any kind of sweets. Of course he used to have
honey at home, and he used to pick and eat all kinds
of wild fruit, wild strawberries and raspberries and
blackberries, but he never had sweets. There were
not such things in those days. Nobody had sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
because it was not made then. Even salt, which is
so common with us that you can buy as much as you
can carry for sixpence, was very scarce among Tig’s
people. The Medicine Men of the tribe always had
some which they got from some other Medicine
Men, who got it from some other Medicine Men
who lived by the sea-shore. But they were not willing
to part with it except in little pieces; and for a
handful of salt a man would have to give something
valuable in exchange.</p>

<div class="width153">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-o.png" width="153" height="150" alt="decorative letter O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">ONE night, after the cold-time was
over, Gofa and Tig and his little
brother Ban and his little sister
Fearna and Sona the baby were in
the hut waiting for Garff to come
home from hunting. Gofa was making porridge for
supper, and Tig and Fearna and Ban were waiting
to have theirs, for they were hungry. By this
time Gofa’s store of corn was low, and she used
to put a handful or two of pounded-up acorns
with the corn-meal when she made porridge or
bread.</p>

<p>Gofa was stirring the porridge when she heard a
noise outside the hut. She jumped up and snatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>a club and stood ready to strike if there should be
an enemy at the door. Then she called out:</p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="497" height="700" alt="woman creeping toward a doorway with a club in her hand" />
<div class="caption"><p>Gofa Alarmed</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>“It is I, Tosgy,” said a voice outside. So Gofa
laid down the club and pushed aside the stone at
the doorway, and then Tosgy crept into the hut.
Tosgy was not a strong man like Garff. He had had
his feet frost-bitten in the cold-time, and he could
not run and so he could not hunt. The people called
him Tosgy because he had big teeth.</p>

<p>“See,” he said, “I have brought you a beautiful
fox-skin&mdash;a fine one, a rare, fine one; and I beg you
give me some meal for it, a little meal for my children.
It is now five days, nay, six days since we have
eaten bread. We have had naught to eat but the
green buds and leaves that we have plucked from
the trees and boiled&mdash;and oh, but they are poor
stuff! There is no goodness in such food, and my
little ones are ailing. I beg you take the skin and
give me meal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Gofa took the skin and looked at it; and she said:</p>

<p>“My man brings me many skins as good as this
one; but you shall have the meal for the little ones&mdash;mixed
meal, look you, such as we have to eat
ourselves. We have no better.”</p>

<p>Then she went to a jar that was standing beside
the fire and took out a handful of baked corn and
gave it to Tosgy and said:</p>

<p>“Munch that, while I put up the meal&mdash;it is
hard fare, but thy teeth be good.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” said Tosgy, “my teeth be good! would
that my feet were as sound!” So he munched the
parched corn.</p>

<p>Then Gofa threw some more meal into the porridge
pot, and told Tig to go on stirring the porridge.
And she took Tosgy’s jar which he had
brought and filled it up to the brim with meal; and
then she took a smaller pot and filled it up with
porridge from the pot beside the fire; and gave it to
Tosgy to take home to his children. And Tosgy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
thanked her many times and made haste to go home
with the provender. As he crept out at the doorway,
Gofa shouted after him:</p>

<p>“Mind how thou goest! Spill none, and see that
my bowls are brought safe back when they are
empty&mdash;which they soon will be methinks with
all those hungry mouths to fill!”</p>

<p>Very soon after this visitor had gone, Garff came
home. Gofa did not pick up a club to brain him
with. She knew who was coming before he got to
the hut, for she heard his whistle; and Flann his
dog came to the door and whined and scratched
outside. Then Garff crept in and threw down on
the floor the game that he had brought home&mdash;a
squirrel and two water-rats.</p>

<p>“Poof!” he said, “I am tired! Up hill and down
dale all day long and never a sight of game. As for
the deer, there is no getting near them, and what
we shall do if this goes on I cannot tell. But the
wolves! why, they be as bold now as ever they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in the cold-time. There were five at least prowling
about a bowshot from the gate.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Gofa, “and thou all alone!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I was not alone,” said Garff. “Darach was
with me and he let fly at one and shot it through
the body&mdash;a rare long shot&mdash;and the rest, as their
way is, fell upon it and pulled it down and tore it to
pieces. We went round to see that the cattle be all
safe within walls. I never knew the wolves so fierce
save when there was snow on the ground. But the
cattle be safe; that’s one good thing; the cattle be
safe. Give me some of that porridge, I am hungry.”</p>

<p>So Gofa brought him some porridge and a bowl
of milk, and he sat by the fire and ate his supper,
and afterwards ate some parched corn, munching
a few grains at a time, while Gofa set to work to
strip the fur from the squirrel and the water-rats to
make them ready for cooking the next day.</p>

<p>By this time Tig and the other children had gone
to lie down to sleep in the part of the hut where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they slept. Then Gofa told Garff about Tosgy and
how he came to ask for meal.</p>

<p>“I fear there will be many hungry mouths
among our folk,” said Garff, “before the fruits are
ripe and the harvest fit to be gathered in; and with
game getting so hard to kill too! I am glad thou
couldst spare some meal.”</p>

<p>“But I shall give him back his fox-skin,” said
Gofa, “for they are very poor. See now, I will tell
his wife to send one of the children for it next time
she is making a coat!”</p>

<p class="drop-capi4">ALTHOUGH the people had learned
how to grow corn, they could
not raise large crops. They tilled
the ground only in patches, and
they had no ploughs or harrows,
nor had they any horses to work the land with. All
the work was done by hand, and mostly by the
women, although sometimes the old men and the
boys helped them. They cleared the ground beyond
the edge of the forest, and turned up the soil with
their hoes.</p>

<p>When a woman wanted to make a hoe, she
chose a bough of a tree that had a bend in it.
Then she cut and trimmed this to the shape of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>the letter L, and, last of all, bound a flint, which
had been chipped to a broad point, to the shorter
limb of the bough with strips of hide; and so
she had a useful tool for tilling her plot of
ground.</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" width="493" height="700" alt="woman holding a hoe with a baby tied to her back and a child walking toward fields" />
<div class="caption"><p>Going to the Fields</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>In the spring the people sowed their corn. They
worked in parties, and as they moved across the
field plying their hoes, they used to sing songs to
keep in time with one another, one singing the
verses and the rest all joining in the chorus. They
were fond of singing, whether they were at work or
at play; they had songs and choruses for the different
occupations, marching songs and harvest
songs and songs about hunting the deer; and at the
feast-times they sang these songs and the choruses
over and over again.</p>

<p>When the time came to gather in the corn, the
people often found their crops very short, for
pigeons and rooks and other birds came and ate the
corn, and the wild deer sometimes broke through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the fences and trampled down even more than they
ate.</p>

<p>But for all that, the harvest was always a busy
time. The women cut off the heads of the corn with
their flint knives and carried it home in baskets.
They stored it up in the store-houses in the winter
village, and when the last of the crops had been
gathered in, the people went back to the village for
the winter. Then for many days they kept the feast
of the harvest. There was plenty to eat and drink,
and everybody ate and drank a great deal; and they
sang and danced and offered sacrifices, and gave
thanks to their gods for the crops that they had
gathered in.</p>

<p>The pit-hut, which was Gofa’s store-house for
her corn, was near the hut in which she and Garff
lived. Like her neighbours she stored up the
ears of the corn, and only rubbed out the grain
when she wanted a supply for making cakes or
porridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the harvest of the fields there was the harvest
of the woods to be gathered in. Tig used to enjoy
more than anything else the days when they
gathered the acorns. The women used to go in large
parties, with some of the children and some of the
young men, all singing and shouting. Then, if a
savage old wild boar was routing about among the
fern, and munching the fallen acorns, he would listen
to the noise of the party coming up, and grunt
angrily at being disturbed, and move away into
the deep forest; for he feared men, and never
attacked them unless they chased him and brought
him to bay.</p>

<p>It was splendid for Tig and the other boys&mdash;climbing
into the oak trees, and getting as far out
as they could upon the branches to shake down the
ripe acorns. Sometimes they gathered a handful of
fine ones and threw them at one another or pelted
the women who were gathering underneath; and
then Gofa, or some one else’s mother, would look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
up and say: “Have done now, little badling! or
surely we will leave thee in the forest here to-night,
and Arthas the She-bear will catch thee and carry
thee to her den to make a supper morsel for her little
ones!”</p>

<p>And they gathered blackberries and nuts and wild
strawberries, and sat down all together to eat the
fruit with the corn-cakes that they had brought;
and those who had not had enough to eat, nibbled at
the acorns. But nobody ate many of these, because
they were meant to be carried home for storing,
and not to be eaten raw at any time. They were to
be dried beside the fire in jars, and then pounded up
and mixed with corn-meal to make it go further.</p>

<p>At sunset the people all joined into a company
again to go home. Every one had a load. There were
big baskets that took two to carry, and smaller baskets
for one, and little baskets for the children: and
some of the lads and women had wallets made of
deer-hide slung over their shoulders.</p>

<p>And so they carried home the harvest of the
woods, day by day until all the trees were bare&mdash;and
you may be sure that the squirrels had to be astir
very early in the morning to get a share of acorns
and nuts for their own winter stores.</p>

<div class="width146">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-i.png" width="146" height="150" alt="decorative letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IN Garff’s village there lived an old
man named Crubach. The people
called him Crubach, the Lame
One, because when he was a young
man he had had a dreadful fight
with a bear, and had been nearly torn in pieces. The
bear clawed his face all down one side and tore his
arm, and would speedily have killed him, but that
two or three brave men dashed in with blazing firebrands
and thrust them in the bear’s face; and
among them they killed the bear and saved poor
Crubach. In time he recovered; but he was never
able to hunt again, because he was lame and could
not hold either a bow or a spear. But he was strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and clever, and he did not mean to have to beg his
daily bread. So he became a grower of corn; and in
time he was the greatest grower of corn in the village.
He tilled his plot of land more carefully than
the women, and always saved his best corn for seed;
and his seed was so much better than other people’s
that they used to go to him at the time of sowing,
and take meat or skins or firewood to exchange for
seed-corn.</p>

<p>Then the men began to see that after all Crubach
had done well, even though he was not a hunter;
and in course of time, some of them took to working
among the crops and laying up more corn for the
winter store.</p>

<p>Besides his crops of barley and wheat, Crubach
grew flax, of which the fibres were dressed and spun
into thread. He used to keep a supply of sticks
trimmed and ready for making bows and arrow
shafts and spear-shafts; he also made wooden cups
and bowls and wooden tubs. And he used to gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wild plants of different sorts and use them for medicine;
and it was said in the village that nobody except
the Medicine Men knew more about plants
than Crubach.</p>

<p>When Tig grew big enough to run about by
himself, he became great friends with Crubach. The
old man was generally to be found working on his
piece of land, or sitting to scare away the birds from
his crops. He used to teach Tig the names of the
animals and birds, and tell him things about them&mdash;such
as why Broc the badger never walks out
except at night; why Graineag the hedgehog wears
a prickly jacket; where Gobhlan the swallow goes
in the cold-time; why Seabhac the kestrel hawk
hangs in the air beating her wings; and who it is
that haunts the reedy marshes, crying: “Boom-boom!”
And when Crubach gathered in his harvest,
he bound a little sheaf of corn for Tig, and gave it to
him, and said: “This did I promise thee on the day
when we were in the field together scaring the birds.”</p>

<h2 class="leftalign"><i>Chapter the Ninth</i></h2>

<p class="ph3"><i>The Story of the Wolf that hunted alone</i></p>

<div class="width155">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-t.png" width="155" height="150" alt="decorative letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">THIS is one of the stories that Crubach
told to Tig. No one now
could tell it exactly as Crubach
told it, but it was something like
this:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a wolf that hunted
alone. Why did he hunt alone? Now listen, and I
will tell thee.</p>

<p>One night he went out with his brother wolves;
and they found the trail of a stag and hunted him
in the forest. And the stag stood at bay in a rocky
place and thrust with his antlers and killed three
wolves, and another he killed by leaping upon it
suddenly, with his feet altogether, and breaking its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
neck. So this wolf, who was a coward, said: “I
have no mind to be killed. I will not hunt stags.”
So he went home to his den and got no supper that
night.</p>

<p>On the next night he went out again with the
pack, and they found the trail of a wild bull and
hunted him in the forest. And the wild bull stood
at bay in a thicket, and tossed four wolves and
trampled them underfoot and gored them with his
horns. So this wolf said: “I have no mind to be
tossed by a wild bull. I will not hunt wild bulls.”
And he went home to his den and got no supper
that night.</p>

<p>So on the next night he went out to hunt alone.
By and by he saw Sinnach, the old fox, trotting
home with a wild duck that he had caught, slung
across his shoulders. So he called out:</p>

<p>“Ho, there! Deliver up that duck!”</p>

<p>But Sinnach was not afraid when he saw that the
wolf was alone, and he ran to his den, which was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the rocks close by, and he dropped the duck inside,
and then he came to the door and called out to the
wolf: “Ho, there, friend! Go and catch a duck
for thyself!” And then he went back into his den.</p>

<p>And the wolf went on, and soon he came to the
village of the Beavers. The village of the Beavers
was in a pond; but the pond was frozen over, because
it was the cold-time; and the wolf walked on
the ice and came to the hut where the grandfather
beaver lived. The grandfather beaver was at home
with his family, all sitting snug in the house; and
the wolf knew that all the beavers were at home
because he could smell them. So he came up close
outside, and he called out to the grandfather beaver
and said:</p>

<p>“Let me in! Let me in!”</p>

<p>The grandfather beaver knew the wolf’s voice,
and he answered:</p>

<p>“Where are thy manners, friend? Come to the
door!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the door of a beaver’s hut is under the
water; and the water was frozen over with thick
ice; and the grandfather beaver knew that the wolf
could not dig through the ice, so he laughed, and
the other beavers laughed too.</p>

<p>When the wolf heard the beavers laugh, he was
very angry, and he snapped out and said:</p>

<p>“I am coming in through the roof!”</p>

<p>So he began to scratch and dig with his paws at
the roof of the beavers’ hut. But the roof of the
beavers’ hut was made of boughs well laid in and
plastered with mud and gravel, and it was all frozen
as hard as the ice on the pond. So when the wolf
scratched, he only hurt his claws and made his pads
very sore; so after a while he had to leave off and
go home, limping on his sore pads. And when
the beavers heard him leave off and go away,
they laughed again, down in their snug house.</p>

<p>So the wolf went home to his den, and he got no
supper that night.</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;">

<div class="caption"><p>The Wolf at the Beaver’s Hut</p></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The next night he went out again and hunted
by himself. And he was so hungry that he sat on his
tail and howled at the moon.</p>

<p>Gearrag, the young hare, heard him, and she
peeped at him from behind a tuft of grass; but she
was not afraid of a wolf that hunted alone, and she
ran off to feed.</p>

<p>And Mulcha the owl heard him; she perched in
the fir tree overhead and cried out: “<i>Whoo-whoo-whoo!</i>
Who heeds a wolf that runs by himself?
<i>Whoo-whoo-oo!</i>”</p>

<p>And Broc the badger heard him. He came up
out of his burrow at the roots of a big oak tree to
go on his midnight prowl; he went on his way,
grunting to himself: “I always go out without a
mate, for that is the way of us badger-folk, but it is
not the way for him; it is not the way of his folk.
No, no!”</p>

<p>By and by the wolf went on again; and he
hunted all the night and found no trail. But towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
morning he smelt the scent of dead game.
And he nosed about and presently he found in a
thicket the body of a hind that had been caught
in a trap by its foot. A man had set the trap, but
he was at home lame with frost-bite in his feet,
and he could not go to his trap. The hind was
dead, and Bran the raven had found it; Bran was
sitting aloft on a bare branch, calling out “<i>Kroagh,
kroagh, kroagh!</i>”</p>

<p>When the wolf found the dead hind in the trap,
he was very glad. He said to himself: “Now I
will have a feast all to myself. It is a good thing
to hunt alone!”</p>

<p>But Arthas the she-bear was near. She too had
smelled out the dead hind, and she meant to make
a meal of it. She saw the wolf, but she was not
afraid of a wolf that hunted alone. So she came
up very quietly behind him and said:</p>

<p>“<i>Humpff!</i>”</p>

<p>The wolf jumped, for he was very frightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
But he snarled and showed his teeth. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Go away! This is mine.”</p>

<p>But Arthas said, “Nay, friend, it is mine!”</p>

<p>And the wolf said, “It is mine, for I killed it!”</p>

<p>But Arthas answered: “If thou didst kill it,
what is this thing upon its foot, and what meaneth
Bran yonder, crying carrion? Thou art a liar and
I shall cuff thee!”</p>

<p>So Arthas lifted her great paw and cuffed the
wolf over the head, and he fell down dead. And
Arthas took the body of the hind and dragged it
home to her den for breakfast for her little ones.
But as for the carcase of the wolf, she saw that
it was nothing but skin and bone; so she left it
there in the thicket for Bran the raven, who sat
in the tree crying carrion, and for Feannog the
crow, who will eat anything. And that is the end
of the story of the wolf that hunted alone.</p>

<h2 class="leftalign"><i>Chapter the Tenth</i></h2>

<p class="ph3"><i>DICK AND HIS FRIENDS: A Talk about
Cattle and Crops</i></p>

<div class="width153">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-w93.png" width="153" height="150" alt="decorative letter W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHEN the chapter was finished, the
boys talked about the plan for
making a dug-out hut, if they
could all be together in the next
winter holidays. Uncle John said
he would not stop them, but he thought they
would find it too hard a task when they came to
dig down into the ground, unless they could find a
place where the soil was deep and sandy.</p>

<p>Dick wanted to know what tools the people of
the old time used when they dug out their winter
huts.</p>

<p>Uncle John took down another book, and showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
them a picture of an old pick-axe made out of a
deer’s antler. But, he said, he did not know what
the men used to do for shovels; perhaps they
scooped up the soil in their hands, and carried it
up to the top of the pit in baskets.</p>

<p>Anyway the boys thought that with their spades
they would be able to dig down fairly deep; and
then, if they were to lay the soil around the top
as they dug it out, they would make the walls
higher.</p>

<p>Joe said it would be great fun to have a real fire
and collect acorns and roast them to see how they
tasted. But Uncle John said they would not find
many acorns in the Christmas holidays: the rooks
and the squirrels would have taken care of that.
But David said they could have some chestnuts
from home and pretend they were acorns. He said
he thought they would be nicer to eat than acorns,
anyway. “Acorns are so bitter,” said he, “I wonder
anyone could eat them at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle John. “But if they were
pounded up and put into a vessel with water, the
water would take out much of the bitter taste; and
then the water could be poured off and the acorn
meal dried and mixed with corn meal, as we read,
for either corn-cakes or porridge.”</p>

<p>Then David asked why the people didn’t keep
larger herds of cattle, so that in the long winter,
when there was no other food, they could be sure
of having beef in plenty.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Uncle John, “now that’s a question&mdash;who
can think of an answer?”</p>

<p>Dick said that wolves would come and kill the
cattle; and Joe said that enemies would come and
steal them.</p>

<p>“Those are both likely answers,” said Uncle
John, “for, of course, it is harder to guard a large
herd than a small one&mdash;but, can’t some one think
of a better?”</p>

<p>David said he expected it was hard to keep cattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the winter, if the people had no byres for them,
and no hay to feed them with.</p>

<p>“That is a good notion,” said Uncle John,
“the people couldn’t take a cow down the passage
into a pit-hut, though no doubt they built cowsheds
of some sort inside the wall of the village.
But cows can’t live on nothing but fresh air, any
more than human beings can; and it must have
been a difficult matter to collect winter forage
for even a small herd in days when nobody made
hay. And then, I daresay, it was not easy to rear
large herds, for the cattle which the people had
were only partly tamed; and some would be apt to
stray away into the forests; and the more a
man had, the more he would lose, both in this way
and from the attacks of wild animals, as Dick
says.</p>

<p>“It is more likely that most men had only a few
cattle at first. Then they naturally tried to keep
for use and for breeding those that were the tamest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and the best; and you may be sure that a
man would not kill a cow that was gentle
and gave good milk, unless he were driven by
starvation.</p>

<p>“But, of course, as time went on, men became
more skilful in rearing cattle and sheep, just as
they became more skilful in growing corn. And
so it came to pass that people had always food at
home, without needing to hunt the wild deer, except
for amusement; but that was not for a very long
while after the time we have been reading about.”</p>

<p>Then Dick wanted to know about the corn that
Crubach sowed. Where did it come from? Was it
wild corn? Uncle John said that was a hard question,
and one that even learned men had never
been able to answer completely. There is no wild
corn in this country, he said, and the original stock
of the corn that Crubach and his neighbours had
must have been brought from some other country
a great many years before Crubach lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are pig-nuts like?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“You dig them up in fields, with an old knife,”
said Joe, “a white flower grows up from them,
earlier in the summer than this. They don’t have
a shell; they are like little potatoes, and taste like
a nut but are rather tough.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle John, “I don’t suppose the
people thought much of pig-nuts, which probably
were not very plentiful in times when there
were fewer meadows; and not easy to get, besides
being rather poor things when you get them, as
Joe says. But the wild fruit that they gathered in
the autumn&mdash;we have read of acorns, nuts and
blackberries&mdash;what other kinds can you think
of?”</p>

<p>“Wild strawberries,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“And raspberries,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Cranberries,” said David, “and blaeberries.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“You say bilberries, or perhaps ‘whorts’&mdash;go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hips and haws.”</p>

<p>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>“Rowanberries?” David asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, very likely: but think of something else&mdash;not
berries at all.”</p>

<p>“Not crab apples?” said Joe, “they didn’t eat
crabs surely?”</p>

<p>“I expect they did. Not that we need guess
about it, for to a certain extent we know. A good
many years ago, the remains of several villages of
about the period of this story were found beside
the shores of some of the lakes in Switzerland.
There was hardly anything of the huts to be seen,
because they had been burned down. But the fire
which had destroyed the huts had preserved some
of the things inside. For instance, jars were dug
out of the silt containing what had once been food,
all charred by the fire but whole and perfect in
shape. There were nuts and acorns and corn of
different kinds, but also crabs or wild apples that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
had evidently been split and dried. Some of these
things are in the British Museum now; and if we
could go and see them, I daresay you would think
them very interesting.”</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>THE STORY OF TIG: How Tig got his First
Bow and Arrows</i></p>

<div class="width147">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-w.png" width="147" height="150" alt="decorative letter W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHEN first Tig and his friends
played at hunting, they mostly had
bows and arrows of their own
making. Tig had made his own
bow, but it was not a good one.
He made it of a hazel sapling which was not a
very tough piece of wood, and not well balanced,
as one end was thicker than the other. His bowstring
was one that his father had thrown away,
and it was old and frayed.</p>

<p>But one day Garff was sitting outside the hut
shaping a shaft for a spear with his flint knife, and
he saw Tig trying to shoot with his weak little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
bow. So he called him, and said: “Bring it hither
to me, little son. It is a poor thing, this bow of
thine. One of these days we must make thee a
better.”</p>

<p>And Tig said: “Make it now, Dad.”</p>

<p>So Garff laid aside his spear, and he went into
the hut and brought out several lengths of wood
from his store, and he looked them over carefully.
He chose one&mdash;a piece of a tough ash sapling,
about four feet long. Then he set to work to
whittle this with his knife until he had shaped it
to the right form&mdash;thickest in the middle and
tapering towards the ends, rounded in front and
flattened at the back; and he scraped it smooth all
over. Then he worked some notches at each end,
using for this a little saw made of flint; and he
fitted a new bowstring to it, and gave Tig his first
real bow. Of course this was not done all in a day,
but Garff worked at it between whiles when he
had time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>And he made the arrows, too, taking from his
stock of arrow-sticks six of the shorter ones. These
he trimmed and scraped, and made a deep notch
at the top of each, to take the bow-string. Then
at the tip he made a deep cut, lengthwise, with
the saw, and fitted in a bit of the leg bone of a
deer, shaped and pointed. Then he cut a very fine
strip of fresh hide and bound it around the base
of the bone point; and afterwards laid the arrows
one by one in the sun, so that the hide might dry
and shrink, and hold the arrow-head tight in its
place.</p>

<p>And Garff took some wing-feathers of a wild
goose and split them; and to each of the arrows
he bound three strips of the feathers a little below
the notch, to make them fly straight. And he made
a quiver of birch bark, bound with bands of hide,
for Tig to carry his arrows in. And he cut a mark
upon the quiver, and the same mark on each of
the arrows, so that Tig might always know his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
own; and he told him to be very careful about his
arrows, not to waste them on chance shots, and
always to recover them after shooting, if possible.</p>

<p>None of the boys had a better outfit than Tig’s.
Among them they made a target out of an old
skin, stuffed with dry grass, and practised shooting
at it. The men taught them how to aim, standing
sideways, on to the target, with feet well apart,
firmly set, and to draw the bow by hooking the
first two fingers of the right hand into the bowstring,
not by pinching the arrow between thumb
and finger. Every boy in the village wanted to
practise and become a good marksman. The boys
who could shoot well and run well were always
thought much of; and sometimes they were allowed
to go hunting with the men.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">ONE day, not long after this, Tig
was bringing in a faggot of sticks
for his mother, when he saw his
father getting ready for a journey.
He had a wallet, with food packed
into it, slung over his shoulders; also his bow and
a quiver full of arrows. He carried a spear in his
hand and had his stone axe slung at his side.</p>

<p>Tig had never been away with his father, and
he wished very much to go. He asked his father
where he was going, and Garff said:</p>

<p>“I am going away over yonder, to get some
arrow-heads from Goba, the spear-maker; but it
is too far for thee to travel. We shall be three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
or more about our journey, and we shall sleep out
at night. Thou art better at home.”</p>

<p>But Tig begged hard; so Garff said he might
go, if his mother would let him; and though his
mother said she feared it would be too far for him,
yet he might go, for he was getting a big boy and
must learn to march like a man.</p>

<p>Four or five men of the village were going with
Garff, and at last they set out. They left the open
ground where the cattle were feeding, and made
their way into the forest, going downward until
they came to the river. They marched along the
river-bank, going up the stream, and then crossed
the water and mounted upward by a track through
the thick forest until they reached the high ground
on the other side of the valley. Here they were on
the open moor; and the men began to practise
shooting for a match. One man shot an arrow
ahead, and then the others, each in turn, aimed
at the first man’s arrow. Then they walked on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and as soon as they were near enough to see how
the arrows lay, they sent Tig to pick them up.
But Tig did not have to ask whose arrow each
one was, because every man had his own mark on
his arrows, and Tig knew the marks just as well
as one of us nowadays knows his own initials on
a pocket-knife.</p>

<p>After sunset they came to a sheltered spot near
a clump of oak trees, and here they camped for the
night. Garff and another man then gathered up
dry grass and dead leaves and twigs, and set to
work with their fire-stick to make a fire. This they
did by setting the fire-stick upright, with its end
sunk into a hole in a little slab of wood that they
had brought with them. Then one pressed his hand
lightly on the top of the upright stick, while the
other brought out a kind of bow with a loose
bow-string, and looped the string around the
middle of the upright stick. Then he worked
the bow backward and forward and so made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the fire-stick spin in its socket, which after
a while became so hot that it set fire to the
dry leaves and twigs that had been laid around
it.</p>

<p>Meantime the other men had collected dry
brushwood and had cut logs, so that they soon
had a good fire. They sat round the fire and ate
of the dried meat and corn-cake that they had
with them, and then lay down to sleep. The men
watched by turns to keep the fire up; for so long
as there was a good blaze they need not fear the
attack of wild beasts. Tig lay close beside his
father; and when one of the men wakened Garff
to take his turn of the watch, Tig wakened too,
and saw the darkness all about them and the sparks
flying upward towards the stars, and he heard the
wind rushing in the tops of the trees around them,
and far away the howling of the wolves hunting
through the night.</p>

<p>After three days of such marching and camping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
they came to Goba’s village. Goba’s village
was in the hill country and at the top of a low,
rounded hill. There was a wall set with stakes all
round the village, and the huts were mostly larger
and better built than any Tig had seen before.
Goba and his sons never went away from their
village. When the people moved off in the summer
and went camping with their cattle, Goba
and his sons stayed at home, working at their
trade. They were all busily working when Garff
and his party arrived.</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="477" height="700" alt="boy watching a man make spear-heads" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Spear Maker</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>All about Goba’s hut there were great heaps of
flint stones, and the floor of the sheds where they
worked was covered with broken pieces and waste
chips. Goba and the other men all had different
pieces of work on hand. Goba was making a spear-head;
he had laid it on a large stone between his
knees and kept striking it sharply and delicately
with a small stone which he held in his right
hand, to finish chipping the edge and make it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>sharp. Tig stood by and watched; and when Goba
saw that Tig was watching him, he let him take
the spear-head in his hands and look at it and feel
the sharp point. It was made of beautiful yellow
flint stone.</p>

<p>“Did you make it out of one of those stones?”
Tig asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Goba, “out of such a one as they
have there, see,” and he pointed to where two
men were fixing a large grey flint stone into a
groove between two great logs. Then one of the
men took a large stone and struck the flint at the
top and knocked off a long flake. This they did
six or seven times; and then they gathered up the
flakes and took them into the shed.</p>

<p>And Goba showed Tig some of the things the
other men were making. Two of them were at
work upon arrow-heads, chipping them very slowly
and carefully; and while Tig was watching, one
man made an unlucky stroke and broke his arrow-head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in two. So he spoiled all his day’s work at
one blow, and there was nothing for it but to take
another flake and begin all over again. But the
other man took a bone tool like a chisel, and pressed
it along the edge of his arrow-head all the way
along, flaking off tiny chips and making the arrow-head
very sharp.</p>

<p>Another man was making a stone axe. He had
shaped it out by hammering it with stones of different
shapes and sizes, and was then busily grinding
the cutting edge by rubbing the axe-head
backward and forward, backward and forward all
the time, upon a large grooved slab of hard sandstone.</p>

<p>“With such as this we can cut,” said Goba;
“we can fell trees and hew them in pieces. There
is nothing like my axes for cutting. Now see, I will
show thee how the men of the old time made their
axes&mdash;they that were in the land before our fathers
came hither;” and Goba picked up a heavy lump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of flint stone that had been roughly chipped into
the shape of an axe-head. “Even such as this were
the axes of those rude folk! Ho! ho! right enough
to brain a wolf withal, but good for naught when
it comes to felling of trees or hewing of timber. We
must have our axes well ground to an edge for felling
timber, little son.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t my father make spears for himself?”
Tig asked.</p>

<p>“Thy father is a hunter, boy,” said Goba. “Look
at me! Can I chase the deer? Nay! Too heavy and
slow am I for hunting. Set thy father’s leg against
my leg and his arm against my arm: then thou wilt
see.</p>

<p>“But set thy father’s hand against my hand, his
eye against my eye! He can spy the deer when they
are many paces distant among the fern, where I
should see naught. But can he see, as I can see, into
the heart of the stone, and can he handle it aright
to shape an arrow or an axe? Nay, he cannot. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I was born to love the good stones, and these my
sons follow after me. It is not born in thee to handle
stones: thou wilt grow up to be a hunter, like thy
father.”</p>

<p>“I should like to be a spearmaker, and make
spears and arrows like these of yours,” said Tig.</p>

<p>“Then thou must come and learn our craft,” said
the old man, “and that is a long matter. Start
young, that’s the only way. The hand must learn,
and the eye must learn, and many a likely piece of
stuff be spoiled before a craftsman is made. But
thou wilt not come. Thy father likes better for thee
to learn how to hunt deer and slay wolves, with the
good stones that I and my sons will make for thee.
It is not born in thee to follow our craft, little son.”</p>

<p>Inside his hut Goba had his store of all kinds of
weapons made of stone&mdash;axes and spears and arrow-heads
and daggers; he also had knives and chisels,
and scrapers to scrape hides with, and little saws,
and many other such things all of flint stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Garff and his men unpacked the goods
they had brought with them&mdash;fine skins, and pickaxes
made of deer’s antlers (of which Goba was
always in want, for digging out the flint), and a fine
buck that they had killed in the forest that morning,
and as much of the crushed corn out of their
stock as they could spare. And these things they
exchanged with Goba for flint arrows and spears
and two or three axes. And Goba gave Tig a javelin
or little spear for his own; because he said that
the party had a long way to travel before they could
get home, and Tig must have his weapon like the
rest, in case they should fall in with wild beasts and
be attacked.</p>

<div class="width148">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-a.png" width="148" height="150" alt="decorative letter A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi4">ARSAN was the oldest man in
Garff’s village; he was so old that
no one knew how old he was.
He could remember things that
happened before anyone else in the
village was born; and he was very fond of telling
stories about the old times. The people liked to
listen to Arsan’s stories, when they were gathered
round the fire in winter, or when sitting out of
doors on a summer evening.</p>

<p>One day in winter, when the snow was thick
outside and the people were keeping at home out
of the storm, many of them gathered together in
Garff’s hut. Old Arsan was there, and the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
asked for a story, and Tig crept near so that he
could hear it. And Arsan said:</p>

<p>“Once, when I was a child, about the bigness of
this youngling here, or less, I beheld Grim the
Hunter. Well do I remember the day when I beheld
Grim the mighty hunter.”</p>

<p>Then the people said: “Tell us a story of Grim
the mighty hunter.”</p>

<p>So Arsan began his story, and he said: “In
the days long ago men were great hunters. There
be none now that are hunters like them of the old
time. For in the old time there were beasts more
and mightier than there be nowadays, and the men
who hunted them were mightier likewise. There
was Laidir who once tracked out the great wild
ox and slew him in the swamp. And there was
Curad who wore about his neck a necklace of three
rows of the fang-teeth of wolves that he had slain
with his own hand. But greater than Laidir and
greater than Curad was Grim, the mighty hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“When Grim was but a little more than a babe,
he took a spear and killed a wolf-cub that his father
had brought into the hut alive. And it was said of
him, by them that were wise among the folk, that
he would live to be a slayer of beasts.</p>

<p>“Now when he was grown a tall youth, it befell
one day that he went forth into the woods to kill
meat. He carried his bow and arrows at his back,
and in his hand a spear. By his side hung his trusty
axe, a stone of the best. So he went, armed like
a man, but without the wit of a man, and heeding
naught.</p>

<p>“For by and by he spied a bear-cub moving
among the fern in an open space of the woods.
Now Grim greatly desired to have the skin of a
bear-cub, so, without more ado, he shot at the
bear-cub thrice with his arrows and wounded it;
and then ran after it and smote it as it ran, and
slew it. And then, since it was too heavy a beast
for him to carry off, he fell to skinning it there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>and then, so as to load himself with the hide and
come again for the meat. But suddenly he heard
a terrible roar behind him, and turning round he
saw a great big she-bear, that was the mother of
the cub, coming upon him out of the forest.”</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="474" height="700" alt="bear on a tree limb" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Bear</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>Then some of the people cried out: “Nay, tell
us now&mdash;surely she slew him not!”</p>

<p>And Arsan said: “Nay, she slew him not. For
Grim was but a youth then, and as ye know he was
thereafter an old man dwelling among the people.
Nay, she slew him not. But the she-bear came upon
him with a terrible roaring. She was dreadful to
look upon, of a vast bigness, her eyes like hot fire
and her jaws dripping foam. And Grim turned and
ran for his life; but she ran faster than he, and would
surely have caught him, but that he won to a tree,
and climbed up instantly out of her reach.</p>

<p>“Then the she-bear climbed up into the tree
after Grim. So he crept out upon a long branch,
and the bear made ready to follow him. Then Grim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
fitted an arrow to his bow and took steady aim and
shot, and shot again, and wounded her in the body.
But she came on, nevertheless, growling, and mowing
with her great jaws. Then Grim worked himself
along to the end of the branch and held by his
hands, and swung and so dropped to a branch below.
And the she-bear turned herself about and climbed
down to that branch and came along towards him
as before. And, again, Grim drew two arrows on
her and wounded her twice again, and the blood
came streaming from the wounds. Then Grim saw
that he had only three arrows left. So again he
swung from the branch and dropped, and thence to
the ground; and he stood up and shot all three
arrows into the bear from beneath, with all his
might and main. And she turned to climb downwards,
and ripped the tree with her great claws, and
fell to the ground; and though she was stricken to
the death, she reared herself on her hind legs and
made as though to set upon him. Then, being eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to kill, he picked up his spear and hurled it, so that
it pierced the bear’s breast, and she fell forward,
tearing and biting at the spear. Then Grim ran in
upon her with his axe, and clove her skull and made
an end of her. And he cut out his arrows from her
carcase and struck off her four paws and took
them; and he took the skin of the bear-cub. And
then, because it was near to nightfall, he hastened
home.</p>

<p>“And he and some of the people came on the
next day to the place, and, lo! the wolves had
devoured the carcases of the she-bear and of the
bear-cub in the night, and there remained not even
the bones of them.</p>

<p>“And Grim made him a necklace of the claws
of the she-bear that he slew on that day; and it was
ever about his neck. This have I seen. And
it was meet that he should wear her claws for
bravery and strength; for he slew her with his own
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thus was Grim great and famous among the
people; and far be it from me to name his name
to his hurt. Howbeit, he was a mighty hunter!”</p>

<p>And the people all said: “Aye, surely that was
he&mdash;he was a mighty hunter!”</p>

Weapons</i></p>

<p class="drop-capi4">AS soon as he had finished reading
the chapter, Uncle John went to a
cabinet and took out a box in which
were a number of flint arrow-heads
of different shapes and sizes. Some
were not longer than one’s finger-nail, and some were
two or three inches in length, long enough to be used
as heads for a javelin, such as Goba gave to Tig. Some
were oval in shape like the leaf of a privet bush,
others were shaped like the ace of diamonds; some
had barbs at each side, and some a tang between the
barbs for fixing the head to the shaft of the arrow.</p>

<p>Uncle John asked David if he could tell why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
some of the arrows were barbed and some not. Joe
said that perhaps only the cleverest men could make
the barbed arrows; the others were easier to make.</p>

<p>“No doubt that was so,” said Uncle John, “but
all the same, they made a great many of both kinds.”</p>

<p>Dick said perhaps the plain arrows were for
shooting at a target, but the barbed ones for killing
things.</p>

<p>“I expect,” said Uncle John, “that the barbed
arrows were used in battle. A barbed arrow cannot
be plucked out of a wound, and so it is more deadly
than the other. The plain arrows were generally
used in hunting. When a man had shot a deer or a
hare, he wanted to be able to pull out his arrow at
once and use it again, but a barbed arrow sticks in
the wound and cannot be pulled out.”</p>

<p>Dick wanted to know if one of these little arrow-heads
would really kill a big animal like a deer.
David said, “Yes, of course it would. It is as big as
a rifle bullet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it wasn’t shot as hard as a rifle bullet is,”
Dick said.</p>

<p>“However, these arrows were shot quite hard
enough,” said Uncle John. “Some years ago the
skeleton of a man was found in a cave in France.
The man had evidently been killed in battle in the
old times that we have been reading about, for
sticking in his backbone was the head of a flint
arrow, which had been shot at the man with such
force that it had pierced his clothing and his body,
and had half buried itself in his spine.”</p>

<p>Then Uncle John opened another drawer in his
cabinet, and took out a stone axe-head, beautifully
ground and polished, shaped to a cutting edge both
back and front, and with a hole drilled through for
the shaft. The boys all looked at it and handled it,
and Joe said:</p>

<p>“How could men cut down trees with an axe
like that? It would never be sharp enough to cut
wood with, surely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think this one was a battle-axe,” Uncle John
answered, “because it is small and very carefully
finished, as you see, and ornamented with these lines
at the top. Axes for cutting wood were larger and
plainer, I daresay. But even then, of course, they
weren’t such useful tools as our steel axes that we use
nowadays. Has anyone of you ever heard what else
the men of those old times used, when they wanted
to fell a big tree?&mdash;Why, fire! They lighted a fire
at the foot of the tree, and when it was burnt out,
they hacked away the charred wood and lighted
the fire again&mdash;and so on, until they got the tree
down. Then they had to chop and chop with their
axes to trim the trunk; so it was a long business.
But they managed it all the same; for they needed
hewn wood for many purposes, of which, no doubt,
the book will tell us later on.”</p>

<p>The next day, out on the heath, the boys gathered
flint stones and tried to make some arrow-heads.
They found it very hard work. It was easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to knock off pieces that had a cutting edge or a
sharp point; but it was very hard to chip these
flakes into anything like the proper shape. They
all tried for a long while, and banged and cut their
fingers, without producing a single good specimen;
and this they found a little disappointing. But, as
Uncle John reminded them, Goba and his men were
old hands at the business, and no doubt they had had
to spend a long time learning and practising it
before they could do it well. “And even then,” said
Uncle John, “how long do you think it would take
a skilled man to make a single arrow-head?” The
boys all guessed about an hour or two. “Well, of
course, we don’t know,” said Uncle John. “But I
can tell you this. Some years ago two Englishmen,
who were travelling in the wild parts of North
America, came across a tribe of Red Indians who
had nothing but stone weapons. And the Indians
told them that even the cleverest workman of the
tribe could not make more than one arrow-head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in a whole day’s work. So a dagger, or a long spear
or a stone axe, especially of the sort that was ground
to an edge at both ends and polished all over, must
have taken weeks or even months to make.</p>

<p>“In the British Museum,” Uncle John went
on, “there is a large collection of very wonderful
flint weapons. Some day we will all go to London,
and Dick shall take us to the Museum to see
them; and besides these we shall see the hammer-stones
that were used for chipping flints with, and
the grinding stones on which the stone axes were
rubbed and ground to an edge.”</p>

<div class="width155">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-t.png" width="155" height="150" alt="decorative letter T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">THE pond from which the women
of the village used to get water for
drinking and washing and cooking
was outside the village on the top
of the hill. It was always full of
good water, even in dry weather. The women
dipped their jars there, and the cattle drank from
it, but there was always plenty of water. No one
had ever known the pond to run dry.</p>

<p>However, one day when the men had all gone
hunting, some of the women went to the pond to
fetch water. But soon they came back and ran about
among the huts, crying out, “Oho, oho! The pond
is dry! The pond is dry, oho! oho!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the other women came out of the huts,
and some of the old men and boys with them, and
they all made haste to go to the pond. When they
got to it, they found that what the first woman had
said was true. There was not a pond at all, but only
a puddle where the pond had been. And the women
tossed up their arms and wailed, “Oho-ho-ho! the
pond is dry!”</p>

<p>Then during many days the people were sadly
troubled for want of water close at hand. The women
had to go in parties down to the river in the
valley and carry the heavy jars of water all the way
up the hill to the huts. And the men had to beat
a track through the woods and take the cattle down
to drink at the stream, and guard them carefully
going and coming for fear of wolves, every man
carrying his weapons: and this kept the men at
home and hindered them from hunting.</p>

<p>So they sent for a wise man, called a Medicine
Man, to come to tell them what they might do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
bring back the water. And the Medicine Man
said, “Make a feast and dance and sing and call
upon the gods, praying them to send rain; and the
rain will come and fill up the pond.”</p>

<p>So the people made a feast, and they danced for
many hours and sang all their songs over and over
again, and yet no rain came. However, after three
days there was a thunderstorm, and much rain fell;
but it did not fill up the pond.</p>

<p>Then they asked the Medicine Man again, and
he said: “Let the people dance and sing and call upon
the gods again. And afterwards let the women take
jars and go and fill them at the river and bring them
up and pour out the water upon the pond. Then
the spirits of the water will return, and the pond will
be filled.” So the people did all this; and the women
carried up jars and jars full of water from the river
and poured it into the pond. But the water sank
away faster than they could pour it in, and there
was nothing left but a puddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they asked the Medicine Man again. And
he went and brought two other Medicine Men, and
they walked round and round the pond with their
wands in their hands. Then they said: “The gods
are angry and have taken away the water. They
will not send it again unless the people offer sacrifices.
Let an ox be sacrificed.”</p>

<p>So the people took an ox and led it out of the
fold and brought it on to the hill-side and killed it
for a sacrifice. And they made fires and cooked
the meat, and feasted and danced, singing their
songs and calling on their gods. They kept up the
dancing all night long; and every hour during the
night they sent men with torches to see if the pond
was filling up. But every time the men returned
and said, “Nay, there is no water!” And in the
morning they went again, but there was no water
and nothing but a puddle. And all the people were
very sad.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>What Arsan said about the Old Pond</i></p>

<p class="drop-capi3">THAT day it happened that Tig
found Arsan, the old man, sitting
in the sun outside his hut;
so he came near and the old
man called him and bade him sit
down. Tig had often heard people say that Arsan
knew many things, so he made up his mind to ask
him about the pond.</p>

<p>“How is it that our pond has gone dry?” Tig
asked.</p>

<p>“What is it that the wise ones say?” said the
old man.</p>

<p>“They say that the water-spirits are angry and
have gone away,” Tig answered; “and they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
bidden my father and all the folk to offer sacrifices
and to dance and sing. And all has been done
as they have said; but the spirits do not come
back. Will they come back, thinkest thou, grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I do not think they will come back,”
said Arsan.</p>

<p>“Then shall we have no water to drink?” asked
Tig.</p>

<p>But Arsan answered: “Now heed and I will
tell thee! ’Tis not the first time I have known the
water-spirits to go away. Once before I have seen
this thing happen: not here, seest thou, but in
another village where I dwelt once. Oh, ’twas dire!
The water dried up, and there was none for man or
beast. And all that we could do availed naught&mdash;ay,
though we offered sacrifice of cattle, it availed
naught.”</p>

<p>“Did the Medicine Men come then?” Tig
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay, they came.”</p>

<p>“And what did they say?”</p>

<p>“They said it was not enough. They called to
mind a custom of our fathers that was wont to be
observed of old time when the gods were angry;
and they chose out a youth and slew him as a sacrifice.
But it availed not; the waters did not return.”</p>

<p>“And what did the folk do then?” Tig asked.</p>

<p>“What did they do? Why then at last they
sought counsel of the old men that had wisdom,
and knew how to make a right dwelling place for
the water-spirits.”</p>

<p>“Was not our pond a right place for the water-spirits?”
Tig asked.</p>

<p>“Now listen, boy, and I will show thee. How
is it with us? Do we dwell always in one place?
Nay, thou knowest we do not. We shift with the
cattle and go from place to place; we cannot abide
in one place always. So do the spirits. It is true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that after a while we come back to our village
here; and so, perchance, might they return, if we
should be content to wait for them; but meantime
the folk and the cattle would have no water to
drink. So what’s to do? Why we must make them
a new home. That’s what we must do&mdash;make them
a new home!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t the Medicine Men make it?” Tig
asked.</p>

<p>“Speak not of them, boy,” said Arsan. “They
know their own ways. I am an old man, but I know
not the ways of them. I bethink me of the old
times that are past long ago, and of what our
fathers did to prepare a dwelling-place for the
water-spirits.”</p>

<p>“What did they do, grandfather?” Tig asked.</p>

<p>“Nay, now, be content. I have said enough,”
the old man answered.</p>

<p>But that night when Tig was in the hut with
his father, he said to him, “Father, I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
talking with Arsan. He knows how to make the
water-spirits come back and fill up our pond
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he knows, does he?” said Garff. “Then he
must tell us.”</p>

<h2 class="leftalign"><i>Chapter the Seventeenth</i></h2>

<p class="ph3"><i>How they made the Pond anew</i></p>

<div style="width: 145px">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-s.png" width="145" height="150" alt="decorative letter S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">SO on the next day Garff called some
of the men of the village, and they
went to the chief’s hut and told him
that Arsan knew of a way to bring
back the water-spirits and fill up the
pond again. The chief was glad when they told
him this, and he sent to the old man, asking him
to come to the council and make known his
plan. Arsan came willingly. The men sat round in
the chief’s hut, and Arsan stood up and spoke.</p>

<p>“It is many years ago,” he said, “I was a young
lad then, but I remember. The spirits of the water
did quit the pool where we were wont to drink.
Suddenly they went, no man knew why; nor would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
they return, though we danced without ceasing
for a night and a day, and sang and offered cattle
in sacrifice to the gods. Then it was said by one
of the Medicine Men that the high gods were
angry and that the killing of cattle would not
appease them. So the folk took a goodly youth
and bound him hand and foot and slew him for
a sacrifice. But still the water came not again.</p>

<p>“Then arose one of the folk, an old man that
had understanding, and he said: ‘Are not the
spirits even as we? Do we abide always in one
house? Shall not the spirits desire to leave their
old dwelling-place and seek a new one? Do we
not know that the deer on the hills abide now in
one place and now in another: and the wild geese,
do they not fly from one place to another? and do
not the bees go forth in bands when the time is
come for them to seek a new resting-place? So
do the spirits of the water. They seek a new place
to dwell in. Let us make them a dwelling-place.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“So when our fathers heard these words, they
made haste to prepare a dwelling-place for the
water-spirits after a manner that I remember and
can show. Many days they toiled; and when the
work was finished, they feasted and danced all
night and sang the ancient songs. And in the
morning, lo! the waters were returned.”</p>

<p>Then the chief said: “So this manner of making
a new place for the spirits of the water is known
to thee, and thou canst tell it.”</p>

<p>“It dwells in my mind, and I can tell it,” said
the old man. “But every one must work and do as
he is bid for many days. The hunting-gear must
be laid aside, and every man must work.”</p>

<p>So the chief and all the men laid aside their
hunting-gear and set to work. And this is what
Arsan made them do.</p>

<p>First he walked out with all the men to a place
on the top of the hill, close to the village, where
there was a flat place that was a little hollowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
out like a saucer; and he set the men to work
with hoes to scratch up the earth to make the
hollow place deeper and wider. They gathered
up the earth in baskets, and some of it they threw
away down the hill, and some they laid around the
rim of the hollow and trod it down hard.</p>

<p>Then Arsan sent the men with good, sharp knives
of flint to cut down reeds and rushes and bracken
and tough grass, and bind them into sheaves and
bundles; also he bade them cut birch twigs and
elder twigs and tie them into bundles, too. And
when they had got large piles of bundles ready,
he showed them how to lay the bundles on the
ground in the hollow place, packing them tight
and close together, like a thick mat, or like thatch.</p>

<p>And when this was done, he sent the men in
parties and some of the women with them who
knew where there was good clay to be found;
and bade them dig out clay. Wherever they could
find good clay down in the valley, they had to dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
it out and bring it to the top of the hill. It was
very hot and dry weather, and the people hated
the hard work and were very angry with Arsan.
But the chief and Garff worked hard and cheered
up the other men, and they all worked together.</p>

<p>When they got the clay up to the top of the
hill, Arsan showed some of the cleverest men and
some of the women how to spread it thickly over
the bundles, laying it and daubing it well over.
And some did this while the rest brought more
and more clay; until at last the whole of the hollow
place was thickly spread with clay, puddled
and trodden hard; and the outside edge of the
bundles all round was covered, so that the hollow
place was like a big saucer of clay.</p>

<p>And Arsan bade the people bring up some
smooth, flat stones from the bed of the river, and
these they laid upon the clay at the bottom of the
hollow, and packed them round with more clay,
and laid more stones of the same sort around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
edge, and so made all firm and strong. There only
needed the water to fill up the clay saucer and
make a pond of it.</p>

<p>Then on the day when their task was done,
they made a big feast and ate and drank; and at
sunset they began the dancing, and danced the
whole night long, some dancing while the others
rested; and they sang the song for rain, and its
chorus, and the corn song and its chorus. And
early in the morning when they had sung the
rain song again, they sent men with torches to
look at the new pond. And soon the men came
back running and leaping and crying out: “The
waters are returning!” and next morning they
found that the new pond was half full of water,
and after two nights more it was quite full.</p>

<p>So they all praised the wisdom of Arsan; and
it was a story among them for years and years to
tell how Arsan had shown them the way to make
a dwelling-place for the spirits of the water.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>DICK AND HIS FRIENDS: Dew-Ponds</i></p>

<div class="width165">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-iquote.png" width="165" height="150" alt="decorative letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">I CALL it stupid to talk about
there being water-spirits in a
pond,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I
agree with you,” said Uncle
John. “Of course that isn’t the way we explain
things nowadays; but if you had lived in
those times, I daresay you would have thought as
other people thought.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t spirits that made the water run
out, was it?” Joe asked.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it was,” said Uncle John.
“What I should like to know is&mdash;can any of you
think what did make the water run out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did the sun dry it up?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Perhaps there was a spring and it stopped running,”
said David.</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy you have guessed right, either
of you,” said Uncle John. “That pond of theirs
was a dew-pond filled by dew&mdash;filled from the
clouds; and it went dry not because there wasn’t
plenty of dew in the air to keep it filled up, but
because the pond leaked, and the water ran out
faster than it could come in.”</p>

<p>“So I suppose when they made the new one
with fresh clay, it was watertight and didn’t leak,”
said Dick. “But I don’t understand now how the
dew could fill it up.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t understand why they put the
bundles of fern and brushwood underneath,” said
David.</p>

<p>“It isn’t at all hard to understand, really,” said
Uncle John. “You see there is always a great deal
of moisture in the air. Sometimes it is high up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
then we call it clouds; and sometimes it is low down,
and we call it mist or dew. But there is always
plenty of it&mdash;a never-ending supply. Of course you
know how it comes to be there?”</p>

<p>“The sun draws it up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the sun draws it up. The sun is always
sucking up water from the earth, from the sea and
from rivers and lakes and ponds, and from puddles
in the road and from clothes hung out to dry. And
the warmer the sun is during the day, the more
water it sucks up into the air. But in the night when
the air is cool, some of this water comes back again:
it forms into drops and settles on the grass or on
cabbage leaves, or on a book which you may have
left out all night on the garden seat. You know that
if you go out early in the morning and walk in the
grass, you get your boots sopping wet. So if you
could find a place that was hollow so that water
could gather in it; and if you could keep it cool like
a cabbage-leaf, so that the water would settle in it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and if you could make it watertight below so that
the water wouldn’t leak out, you would have a dew-pond.”</p>

<p>“Why should it be on the top of a hill?” Dick
asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose because the higher up you go, the
more chance you have of getting into the clouds
and the moist air; dew falls more abundantly on the
sides of hills.”</p>

<p>“But why did those people put the bundles of
fern and stuff under the clay?” asked Joe.
“That didn’t help to make it water-tight did
it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Uncle John, “but it helped to make
it cool. If you want water to form out of vapour,
you must give it something cold to form on. Breathe
on a cold window-pane, and see how the tiny drops
of water settle on the cool pane from the water-vapour
in your breath. If you were to take a cold
basin and set it out of doors at night when the dew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is falling, you would soon find the drops of water
trickling down its sides.</p>

<p>“This is just what those people did, only theirs
was a larger plan.</p>

<p>“They made their pond, as we read, and finished
it one day before evening. Then what happened?
All day long the heat of the sun had been warming
the ground round about, but it could not warm the
thick moist clay so much as it warmed the turf
of the hill-side.</p>

<p>“Then, after the sun went down, everything became
cooler. But the clay pond was still the coolest
thing there; and the packing of reeds and brushwood
kept the heat of the earth from passing into
it from below.</p>

<p>“So the dew began to settle in drops upon the
cold clay and upon the smooth stones, and it trickled
down the sides. As we said, there is always plenty
of moisture in the cool night air; and all you need
to do is to provide the proper place for it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
collect in. So it was with the dew-pond in our
book.</p>

<p>“One by one the drops formed and ran together,
as soon as they had found something to run into;
and millions and millions more joined in, coming
as vapour and settling down as water until the pond
was full.</p>

<p>“And so long as the clay bottom of the pond
kept whole and sound, the dew-pond would hold
water, making up at night what it lost by day.
But if once the clay were broken or worn through,
the water would run away into the ground, and
the pond would never fill up again; partly because
it would not hold water, and also because once the
brushwood became soaked, it would fail to act in
keeping the clay cool.”</p>

<p>“Was that why the first pond failed?” asked
Dick.</p>

<p>“I expect it was. I expect the clay bed had in some
way become worn through, so that the pond would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
not hold water. And the people guessed quite rightly
that the only way to mend matters was to make a
new pond, though, as Joe says, they gave an odd
sort of reason for it.”</p>

<p>“Do people make ponds in that way now?”
Joe asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so; though not many people
know much about it, since there are so many other
ways of getting water possible nowadays. But I
have heard that in some parts of the country there
are old men who know how to make dew-ponds.”</p>

<p>“Do any of the dew-ponds that those people
made exist now?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“I believe so, certainly. They are to be found
on the hills, here and there in different parts of
the country. But some learned men say they were
made in later times than those of Tig’s people.
But I will tell you what we will do. To-morrow
we will have a long walk upon the hills and visit a
pond which I believe is an ancient dew-pond; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
we will have a picnic there, and then see what we
all think about this question.”</p>

<p>“When those people had a feast,” said David,
“what did they drink? Only water?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Uncle John. “But I should
think they drank some kind of beer or spirit&mdash;not
very strong, perhaps, because drink has to be well
brewed and kept long if it is to be made strong.
They may have made beer out of corn or even out
of heather-tips, or perhaps they used honey and
made mead: we do not know. The only thing we
can say is that there are hardly any people in the
world who do not make a drink of some kind from
grain or from some part of a plant; and therefore
these old people of ours most likely did the same.</p>

<p>“If Dick will reach me Stevenson’s Poems from
the second shelf there, I will read you one called
<em>Heather Ale</em>, which will make a good ending to
all this dry talk about dew-ponds.”</p>

<h2 class="leftalign"><i>Chapter the Nineteenth</i></h2>

<p class="ph3"><i>THE STORY OF TIG: How Gofa made Pottery</i></p>

<div class="width146">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-i.png" width="146" height="150" alt="decorative letter I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">IT has been said before that Gofa
did all the work of her own
household, not only cooking the
food, but also making the clothes,
and preparing the skins out of
which the clothes were made. Also she made the
baskets for storing and carrying the food in, and
the pottery, too; and when her stock of household
pots had become low, she used to set to work
to make a fresh lot. And this was how she did it.
She went down into the valley to a place by the
river where there was good clay. She took with
her a large basket and a rough-and-ready trowel
made out of the shoulder-blade of a deer. She dug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
out the clay, enough to fill the basket, and carried
it home on her shoulders.</p>

<p>When Gofa was ready to make pottery, she first
prepared the clay by mixing it with coarse sand,
which also she had brought from the river-side.
She moistened the clay with water when she added
the sand, and kneaded it thoroughly with her
hands, just as if she were making dough. She was
always careful to mix the sand and the clay in the
right proportions; for clay without sand, or with
too little, was apt to crack when it came to be
baked, and with too much it was not stiff enough
to mould well into shape. She always saved the
bits of any pots that were broken, and having
pounded them up until they were quite small, she
mixed them up with the new stuff. By long practice
Gofa knew just how to prepare the clay for use.</p>

<p>Having got the clay ready, Gofa took a lump
of it in her hands and laid it on a stone slab which
served her as a working bench. Then, with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
fingers and a smooth stone, and a stick shaped into
a kind of blade, she worked up the clay into a
little bowl, building up the sides against the stick,
and smoothing the inside with her pebble. But
for the larger jars and pipkins she had another
way. She took a round basket shaped like a basin
and set it before her. Then she took a piece of
clay and rolled it with the flat of her hand on the
bench until she had made it like a very long, thin,
clay sausage. Then she picked this up and began
to coil it round from the bottom of the basket,
inside, pinching and pressing it with her fingers
and the pebble until it was flat and smooth. Then
she rolled out another piece and coiled this round
as before, gradually building up the sides of the
pot and pinching the coils together as she went
on. At length, by adding coil to coil, she raised
the sides and neck of the pipkin, which she then
smoothed and finished off outside with the wooden
tool.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Making Pottery</p></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time Gofa kept turning the pot she
was making round and round upon the stone.</p>

<p>“Why do you keep on turning it round and
round, mother?” Tig asked.</p>

<p>“So that I can see what I am doing,” said his
mother. “The pot would be very ugly if one side
bulged out more than the other, wouldn’t it? I
turn it round and round so that I can keep it even
and right.”</p>

<p>“Who taught you how to make pots, mother?”
Tig asked.</p>

<p>“My mother taught me. She was a famous
potter. People used to come to watch her when
she was at work, but they could not make pots
like hers; she had a rare hand in turning. I cannot
turn them as she could.”</p>

<p>“I think you turn yours beautifully, mother,”
said Tig.</p>

<p>All the pots alike, before they were baked, had
to be decorated. This Gofa did with a bone awl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
engraving a pattern of lines and cross-lines and dots
upon the soft clay. She had also a little stamp of
bone with which the dots could be put on in threes.</p>

<p>When Gofa had finished a batch of pots, she
and Tig carried them into the hut to dry, and
generally on the next day she found that even the
larger ones had dried enough in the air to enable
her to lift them out of their basket foundations.
Then she took each one in turn and scraped and
rubbed it outside with a wooden tool, very carefully
and lightly.</p>

<p>After this she took them to where she had a
fire burning out-of-doors upon the ground. She
raked away the fire to one side, and set the pots
where the fire had been, standing them all upside
down, and ranging them together in as small a
space as possible. Then she piled up sticks and
pieces of dried fir tree wood about the pots, and laid
little faggots all round, and raked up the hot ashes
and set fire to the pile. And she and Tig carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
fresh fuel as the fire burned, and kept it going until
they could see the pots all red hot. And then they
let it sink gradually and die down of itself; and
there were the pots baked hard and sound, and fit
for use as soon as they were cold.</p>

<p>Once Gofa had set to work making pottery, she
used to make a good batch at a time; she did not
stop making and baking as soon as she had finished
just what she wanted at the time. For she liked
to have a store of pottery at hand; and if she did
not want to use them all herself, she could always
exchange one or two for something useful that she
might happen to want.</p>

<p>When Gofa or any of the other women wanted
to make a large pankin for holding water or milk
or meal, she used to make a tall basket, like a
bucket, of osiers and reeds, and daub it inside with
clay. The clay was laid on thickly and then
smoothed and trimmed with the stone and the
wooden blade; and the wide neck and the rim were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
moulded by hand. She did not attempt to lift the
pankin out of the basket mould, but set the whole
thing in the fire as it was; and the fire burned off
the basket work, and left the marks of the reeds
showing all round on the outside like a pattern.
And very likely it was the look of this pattern on
the pottery which first gave the women the notion
of graving a design upon the smaller vessels
which they made entirely by hand. The women
generally took pains to make neat patterns by
using different simple tools of wood and bone, and
sometimes they tied a piece of twisted cord round
a vessel, and impressed its mark upon the clay.
Sometimes they did not use a tool at all, nor even
a twisted cord, but made little dents round the
neck of a jar with the thumb nail, and made the
pattern in that way.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHEN TIG was a boy and used to
play at hunting, the chief of his
friends was Berog. Berog and he
were of the same age and equal in
strength; and, though Tig was the
better marksman with the bow and arrow, Berog had
the greater skill with the sling. By this time they
were both tall and strong lads. Each of them had
been out hunting several times with the men, and
sometimes they had made little expeditions by
themselves. But once in the autumn, after the corn
had been gathered in, they planned to have a real
hunt of their own. They saved some food to take
with them, but not much, because men always hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
best when they are hungry. Tig had a new, full-sized
bow, that he had made himself, and his quiver
full of flint-headed arrows, and his stone axe slung
at his side. Berog had his sling and a bag full of
smooth, round stones, and in his hand he carried a
club. And so they set out together.</p>

<p>They did not want to be seen, so they followed
a track into the forest that was not much used by
the men of the village. The sun had not yet risen;
the air was keen, and white mists hung about the
hills. Their plan was to make first for the swamps
in the valley, so as to get a shot at some of the birds
that lived among the reed beds. They had explored
the way before, and had marked trees or laid guide
stones where the track was doubtful; and so they
lost no time in getting down the valley.</p>

<p>As they crossed the hill-side, they saw two hares
cantering away across the open ground, and Berog
slung a stone or two at them, but without success.
When they came to the thickets at the bottom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>they walked warily, for they saw the track of a wild
boar, and they had no wish to meddle with him.
Birds of many kinds were seen. Away over the
water ducks were flying high in a trail; kites and
buzzards soared higher still; and far away in the
distance, like a silvery flag against the sky, some
wild swans were coming over. Grebes and coots
were swimming about in a backwater of the river
seen through the reeds, and a great grey heron rose
from the swamp ahead of the boys, and flapped
away, uttering a loud squawk.</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="472" height="700" alt="three ducks flying over a meadow" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Wild Ducks</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>The boys crouched among the reeds. Tig fitted
an arrow to his bow, and Berog put a stone into the
web of his sling. So they waited for a long time
without moving. All at once the sound of rushing
wings was heard, and then a splash and rush of
water, as a skein of wild ducks flew down near by.
The boys waited eagerly, and in a moment three
ducks appeared, swimming out from behind a clump
of reeds. Tig shot and missed, and his arrow struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
up a spurt of water. Berog slung a stone at the birds
as they rose, and hit one, which fell quacking and
scattering feathers upon the water. At once Berog
tucked up his sark, and waded out to capture the
duck; but it was only wounded, and was too quick
for him, and made its escape among the thick reed
beds.</p>

<p>After this the boys waited for some time without
a chance of another shot; so they left the river-side,
and made their way through the thickets into
the woods, and out on to the open hill-side. Now
Tig took the lead; for with his bow and arrow he
hoped to get larger game than water-fowl. The boys
moved along at a quick pace, keeping within the
cover of the rocks and bushes, in order to hide their
movements. Two or three times they entered the
woods again, to cross the deep glens that divided
the hills; and they forded the streams that rushed
in torrents down the depths. At last they climbed
up a steep craggy place; and, when they reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the top, they lay down flat and spied the ground in
front. Before them stretched a broad hill-top, and
here they hoped to see some game. Presently Tig
moved on, creeping on all fours, and peeped from
behind a rock. Away in the distance was a troop of
wild horses, some of them feeding and some cantering
and wheeling about in play; and as Tig watched
them they took fright at something near them, and
galloped off out of sight.</p>

<p>Then Berog crept up, and they both moved on
across the ridge, carefully screening their movements
and taking cover behind the rocks and bushes
of heather. When they came to the edge, they lay
down again to spy. Then Tig’s eye picked out, far
down below them, an object like a withered branch
of a tree sticking up out of the heather. He called
softly to Berog, who looked also, and they both
agreed that three or four deer were lying down
there in the hollow of the hill-side. Then Tig
plucked some blades of grass as he lay, and threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
them lightly into the air to see how the wind blew,
so that he might keep it in his face in working
round towards where the deer lay. If once he were
to move where the wind might blow the scent of
him towards the animals, they would be sure to
take alarm and move away.</p>

<p>Then Tig turned and went down behind the
ridge, moving at a quick trot, and worked his
way round to a point, as nearly as he could guess
it, close to the hollow where the deer were lying.
Berog stayed behind on the hill-top to watch the
deer and see if they should move.</p>

<p>When Tig reached the bottom, he crept on all
fours for some distance through the heather, and
then lay down to spy. He raised his head gently.
There was the stag lying with its back towards
him about a hundred yards away. Tig studied the
ground and noted every boulder and every tuft of
rushes between him and the stag, and then, lying
flat on the ground, he began to crawl towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
nearest stone. High up on the far hill-top Berog
was watching the stag; but he could not see Tig.
So Tig crept on and on, holding his breath when
he moved, until he reached the point where he
could see the stag quite plainly. It was lying in
an open green space, wide awake, and it kept
turning its head from side to side as if it were on
the watch for its enemies; but it did not see Tig.
When Tig saw its antlers moving, he knew that
it was looking around, and he lay still. But every
now and then the stag turned back its head to
scratch its back with its antlers and brush away
the flies that kept teasing it, and then Tig crept
up a little nearer and got an arrow ready in his
bow.</p>

<p>All at once the wary stag took alarm. It heard
or smelled that an enemy was near, and got up on
its feet. Then, as the stag stood for a second sniffing
the air, Tig leaped up and took aim and shot
at it with all his might. The stag gave a leap forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and bounded away down the slope; but the
arrow had pierced it deep behind the shoulder,
and Tig knew that if only he could follow, he
was sure of his game. He waved a signal to Berog,
and set off at full speed in the blood-stained tracks
of the stag.</p>

<p>The other deer of the herd gathered and fled
over the hill, and Tig saw the wounded one try
to take refuge with them; but they turned on it
savagely and butted it away. Then Tig and Berog
kept up the chase, and at last, in a thicket at the
edge of the forest, they came upon the poor stag
lying dead. They dragged the body into the open,
and then, while Tig stayed by to guard it, Berog
went off to the village for help.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="leftalign"><i>Chapter the Twenty-first</i></h2>

<p class="ph3"><i>Tig becomes a Man</i></p>

<div class="width147">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-b.png" width="147" height="150" alt="decorative letter B" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi4">BEFORE nightfall Berog came
back with some of the men carrying
torches and poles. They tied
the stag’s hind legs and its fore
legs together, and thrust a pole
through, and so carried it home, and Tig and
Berog marched behind. And when they reached
the village, all the people turned out to cheer
them. And on the next day Gofa and some of
the women skinned the deer and cut up the meat.
Every part of the deer’s body they kept for some
use or other&mdash;the meat for food, the hide for
making into leather, the bones to be broken for
marrow and some to be carved into tools, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
brains for greasing and curing the hide, the sinews
to be dried and shredded into thread; and the antlers
Gofa gave to Tig, because he had won them.
And though before that day Tig would have had
to wait on the women while they were cutting up
the stag, and run errands for them, yet now he
did not. He lay outside the hut all day, and ate
his meals when they were brought to him, and
behaved just like any of the men of the village.</p>

<p>For, after this first big hunt on his own account,
Tig reckoned himself a boy no longer. And soon
after this, he became a man, according to the custom
of his tribe. That is to say, the Medicine Men,
who were the rulers of the people in all matters of
custom and religion, took him in hand to make a
man of him. By their orders he fasted several days,
and kept apart from the people, that he might
learn the will of the gods. Then the Medicine
Men took him and some other boys of his age,
and led them into a grove where they said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
gods dwelt; and they taught the boys the names
of the gods and how to call upon them. And they
tried each boy’s courage, and bade him remember
always to be brave and endure pain without flinching;
and they said that to be a coward is worse
than death, and that it is better to die than to give
in or run away.</p>

<p>After this Garff gave Tig a man’s weapons&mdash;a
battle-axe and a dagger of flint, and a shield
such as men used in warfare; and Tig went also
to an old man of the village who was clever at
tattooing, and he tattooed Tig on his shoulders
and chest and arms; and after that Tig felt that
he was really a man.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>DICK AND HIS FRIENDS: Dick’s Pottery and
how he made it</i></p>

<div class="width147">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-w.png" width="147" height="150" alt="decorative letter W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHILE they were reading about
Gofa making the pots, Dick
thought he would like to try his
hand at this sort of work; so, after
the reading, when they went out,
he got a trug and a trowel from the tool-shed and
said that he should go and look for some clay.</p>

<p>“David and I are going fishing,” said Joe; “and
when we have caught some fish, we are going to
make a fire up at the hut and cook them. If you
were a hunter, you would come too; making pottery
is women’s work.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dick; “but if ever you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to be wrecked on a desert island, you might have
to do women’s work, as you call it.”</p>

<p>However, Joe and David got their fishing rods
and set off. Dick went down to the river too, but
he could not find clay anywhere; so he came back
and asked the gardener. The gardener said that a
farmer was having a field drained close by, and the
men were digging out lots of clay. So Dick went
down to the field and filled his trug with clay, and
then he made another journey to the river for fine
sand. However, he did not find it easy to mix up
the clay properly; for it was lumpy and hard, and
when he put water to it, it was sticky. But, after
a time, he got some mixed with the sand into a
stiff paste, and then he was ready to try his hand
at making a pot. He made several attempts at
shaping the clay into a cup and tried to mould up
the sides, using a flat stick and a smooth little
stone that he had picked up by the river. But he
did not succeed very well, as the clay was apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
break or get out of shape, and several times he
squeezed it all up and began again. At last he contented
himself with making quite a small cup
which he could mould into shape with his fingers,
pinching it and trimming it very carefully with
his wooden tool. This one seemed good; so he
made another a little larger, and then set them
aside while he made a fire.</p>

<p>He collected a quantity of chips and sticks, and
soon had a bright fire burning. After it had burned
for about twenty minutes and made some hot ashes,
Dick pushed the fire to one side, and set the cups
upside down on the hot place. It was not easy to
build up the fire again, because it had fallen away
and was nearly out; and when he put on fresh fuel,
the smoke got in his eyes. Also he poked his best
cup with a big stick that he was putting on the
fire, and dented its side; but it was too late to mend
that, and he went on stoking up. He kept the fire
going till he thought the pots must have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
red hot among the ashes, and then he let it die
down. He wondered whether he might try to get
the cups out before they were cool; but he decided
that it was best to leave them until the whole
thing had cooled down. Just then, Joe and David
came back, without any fish, and when they had
heard what Dick had been doing, and had seen the
fire, they all went in to tea.</p>

<p>When they came out after tea, they found the
ashes still quite hot; but they got a garden rake
and raked them off, and there were the two cups
baked light brown and quite hard. The one that
had been damaged was also much cracked; but the
other one was sound except for one little crack,
though it was not very shapely. Dick took it off
to show to Uncle John.</p>

<p>“That’s a good one,” said Uncle John, “but if
you had let them dry longer before putting them
into the fire, they wouldn’t have cracked; and then
you have forgotten something: what is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick looked at his cup, but he could not tell
what it was that he had forgotten.</p>

<p>“Why, the ornament,” said Uncle John. “When
we pay that visit to the British Museum, you will
see that the pottery of the old time always had
ornament on it&mdash;or very nearly always. And I suppose
you found it hard to make a bigger one? I
daresay anybody would until he had had a great
deal of practice. Even the old people that we have
been reading about, who were so clever at making
pots, had to build up their big ones on a wicker frame.</p>

<p>“There is something very interesting about the
wicker-work frames, and you ought to remember
it. It is this&mdash;baskets were made before pottery.
In the very early days, before people could make
pottery at all, they had, at any rate, rude sorts of
baskets. And, I daresay, they sometimes tried to
warm their food in baskets beside the fire. No
doubt the baskets often caught fire and the food
was spoiled. Then some woman who had her wits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
about her thought of daubing the basket with clay
to make it resist the fire. The next thing was to
plaster the clay inside the basket instead of outside,
and next to burn the wicker off altogether;
and so, in course of time, they learned how to make
vessels of clay without any framework at all, except
for the very large ones.”</p>

<p>That evening they spent some time making their
bows. David was making his out of the stem of an
ash sapling that the gamekeeper had given him;
but Joe had got a branch of real yew for his and
was whittling it down with great care. Dick’s
father had sent him a set from London&mdash;a bow
made of hickory with a stout gut bowstring, half
a dozen arrows, and a bracer to wear on his left
wrist as a protection from the string when shooting.
It was very useful to have these to copy from; but
Dick was not content to have only a ready-made
bow, and he also got a good ash stick and set to
work to make one for himself.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">THE men of Garff’s village were
masters of all the land round
about. They had the ground
that they had cleared of trees for
growing corn, and the open
spaces on the hills where their cattle fed: and beyond,
they had their hunting-grounds in the forests
and over the moors, for miles and miles around. It
was not often that any of them travelled beyond
the bounds of their own ground, unless they were
making a journey, such as Garff and his party
undertook when they went to buy flints from
Goba, the spearmaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>One day in the summer, when Garff and Tig
and some of the others were away on a hunting
expedition in the forest a long way from the village,
Tig wandered away alone into the woods; for
there had been a big hunt for two days before, and
the men were all resting in the camp, while the
women cut up the meat. Tig had no need to kill
any game, but he liked to be in the woods watching
the ways of the wild creatures, especially the
birds; and on that day he had not taken any weapon
except a light spear. When he had gone some
distance, he sat down to rest and watch. In front
of him was a thicket of holly trees; and presently
he heard a jay in the hollies, jarring and scolding
as jays do when they spy an enemy. So Tig kept
still and watched. Then the jays set up a loud
screech and flew across towards the tall trees; and
then Tig saw a dog come out into the open, followed
by a lad. The lad gazed around him and
then went back among the trees; but his dog had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
scented Tig, and it began to bark and growl,
bounding out into the open. So Tig stood up and
called to the lad, who at once turned round and
came forward. They went towards one another
and made a sign of peace, and then the lad begged
Tig to help him, for he said that he was in great
trouble. Close by, his father was lying wounded
and unable to move; and he could neither help his
father home, nor yet leave him to go and bring
help from their village.</p>

<p>“Are you then far from your village?” Tig
asked.</p>

<p>“Well-nigh a day’s journey,” said the lad. “We
are of the Lake People and dwell over yonder
among the hills. And yesterday we were out, my
father and I, looking to some traps, when we came
upon the fresh track of a roe-buck. So we followed
the track and came upon five bucks, away down
below there; and my father shot and wounded one.
But it was lightly hit and got away from us, so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
set the dog on its trail and followed it even here.
And after all it escaped us; but what is worse, my
father fell down a rocky place near by, just when
we thought we had got our buck safely. And he
is sorely hurt and has lain here all night; for I could
not leave him, nor was there anyone to help us.”</p>

<p>So Tig followed the young man in among the
bushes, and there he saw the man lying, covered
with a skin cloak. He told Tig that his name was
Dobran, and when Tig told him his name, he said,
“I have heard of thy people and have even visited
thy village long ago. This is a sore mischance that
has befallen me; but truly we should have taken
warning! For as we came forth yesterday, Feannog,
the grey crow, croaked at us thrice, and a fox
crossed our path in the woods: and these be evil
omens both. But now if thou wilt in great kindness
help my son to get me home, thou shalt have
a warm welcome from my people, and I will try
to reward thee in any way thou mayst desire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>So Tig and the youth, whose name was Gaithel,
planned how they might help the wounded man.
They cut down two young trees for poles and slung
the skin cloak upon these, to make a sort of litter,
and on this they laid Dobran, and then lifted it and
carried it between them. The way was rough and
difficult, and they made very slow progress with
their heavy burden; but at last, after a long climb
up a wooded hill-side, they came out upon the top
of a ridge overlooking a deep valley. In the bottom
of the valley there was a lake, surrounded by thick
woods, and near to one side of the lake a little
island. The island was covered with huts, and
joining it to the shore there was a kind of pier or
gangway. Also Tig saw, what he had never seen
before, a canoe on the water, and some people
paddling about in it.</p>

<p>Then the wounded man pointed and said:</p>

<p>“See, yonder is our village where we dwell.”</p>

<p>“Do you keep cattle on the island?” Tig asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for he could see a man driving cows along the gangway.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dobran, “we house the beasts there
too. Sorely crowded are we, and there has been talk
this long while of some of the folk going away
and building a village on a lake that we know of,
two days’ journey from hence.”</p>

<p>“Is there, then, another island in the other lake,
like this one here?”</p>

<p>“Island! Nay, none&mdash;and here is no island!
What thou seest yonder our fathers, that were
before us, built long ago. For they felled timbers
and staked them on the bottom of the lake and
builded their houses thereon, and dwelt there,
even as we dwell.”</p>

<p>When they came to the waterside, they laid the
wounded man down on the ground. Then Gaithel
put his hands to his mouth and gave a peculiar
call, and the people in the canoe heard it and came
quickly to the shore. They lifted Dobran in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
paddled away with him to the landing place; and
Gaithel and Tig walked beside the shore and along
the gangway. When they got to the village, they
were met by a crowd of the Lake people; for Dobran
had spread the news of how Tig had helped him, and
all the people were eager to welcome the stranger
who had shown kindness to one of themselves. But
Gaithel took Tig at once to the hut where Dobran
was lying. His wife had already bound up his injured
limb, and she was then preparing supper; and she
brought food and set it before them, broiled fish
and porridge and curds. After supper many of
Dobran’s friends came into the hut to see him, and
they stayed chatting with him till late; but at last
they all went home, and the household settled down
to sleep.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">ON the next day, Gaithel took Tig
and showed him the village; and
Tig saw what he had taken to be
an island was really a large and solid
platform made of tree-trunks laid
close together. There was a paling of stakes at the
edge of the platform next the water, all round;
and within the paling were the huts, built close
together side by side in rows with narrow alleys
in between, and sheds for the cattle, built of poles
and wattled and daubed with clay like the huts.
Besides their cattle the Lake People had some
sheep, which they prized greatly on account of the
wool, from which the women span yarn for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
weaving into cloth. At the place where the gangway
joined the platform there was a gate of bars
in the paling, and also a rough stairway going
down to the canoes that were drawn up alongside.
In an open place in the middle of the village was
a fire burning on a large open hearthstone; and
Gaithel said that nowhere else on the island was
anyone allowed to have a fire, for fear of burning
down the huts. In another place was a shoot for
rubbish, to which the people had to bring their
household refuse and tip it into the lake. Then
Gaithel took Tig down to the landing stage, and
showed him the canoes that were moored there;
“I know someone who would like to see these
canoes of yours,” said Tig. “He is a man in our
village, called Crubach. He is lame. He makes
troughs in the same way as you make canoes, by
burning out a tree trunk, only of course they are
much smaller; my mother has one to dip hides
in when she is curing them.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Making a Canoe</p></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“My uncle is making a canoe in the wood now,”
said Gaithel. “He has been at work on it for weeks
and weeks. Shall we go and see him at it?”</p>

<p>So they went together into the wood where
Gaithel’s uncle was at work. He had felled a stout
oak tree and had got a portion of the trunk cut off.
This was to be his canoe, and he had already begun
to shape it fore and aft and to hollow it out. He
had a little fire of dry chips and sticks burning in
one place on the top of the log; and in another place,
where he had had the fire burning the day before,
he was hacking away at the charred wood with his
stone axe. There was another man at work with
him, and this man was hacking at the bows of the
canoe; but his axe would not make a deep cut
in the hard oak wood, and he was getting on very
slowly.</p>

<p>Gaithel’s uncle left off work to speak to Tig.
He stood up and wiped his face which was all hot
and grimy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“My boat will be a beauty when she is finished;”
he said, “a rare one! Have you any like her in your
village?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any boats in our village,” said Tig.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;no boats? How do you do to get on
the water then?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any water,” said Tig, “at least
not a lake&mdash;only a pond.”</p>

<p>“Well, yours must be a strange village! No lake
and no boats! However, your men must be spared
some heavy work if they don’t make dug-outs;
though, look you, a man may make five or six
bark canoes or wicker canoes in less time than it
takes him to make one dug-out. But then a log
canoe will outlast you four of the other, let alone
being a deal more comfortable. So never mind the
labour and the sweat, say I; make a good dug-out.”</p>

<p>Then he took up his axe and went to work
again.</p>

<p>Then Gaithel took Tig back to the lake, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
they got into a canoe and rowed on the lake. In
the canoe was a spear with a long, fine-pointed head
made of bone, barbed on both sides. This, Gaithel
said, was a fish-spear; and he showed Tig how it
was used in spearing large fish when the Lake
People used their drag-net. The nets were kept at
home, so that the women might see that they
were kept properly mended.</p>

<p>“But when we are fishing,” said Gaithel, “we
have the net weighted at the bottom with stones
to sink it, and the one end is held up in one canoe
and the other in another, and the canoes paddle in
ashore, dragging the net between them. Then some
of us wade out into the water, and spear the fish
or catch them with our hands if we can, and then
the net is drawn in closer until we get the rest,
but sometimes some of them get away.”</p>

<p>Then Gaithel took Tig back to the hut, and
he stayed to talk to Dobran, and told him that he
thought the village a very wonderful place; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he asked Dobran why it was that the fathers of
the Lake People built their village on the water.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Dobran, “they built it thus that
they might be safe from the attacks of wild beasts
and from their enemies. As I told thee, they made
the platform first, felling trees in the woods and
piling them here, before ever they could set one
pole of a hut. And with great labour they did this,
building as large as they could; but even so, the
space is too small.</p>

<p>“We are sorely crowded, as I said before; and now
some of the younger men choose rather to build
huts on the shore, hard by, where we have our
cornland and the pasture for the cattle; though we
who are older like the old ways best. Of course the
wolves and such like are not so much to be feared
as they were in our fathers’ days; and as for enemies&mdash;why,
we have lived in peace many years and perhaps
we have naught to fear. Nevertheless, I promise
thee, if enemies should come to fight us, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
folk who have built their houses and their byres
and their sheepfolds away on the land there, with
naught but a stockade around them, would speedily
flee for shelter to our stronghold here on the
water.”</p>

<p>Dobran’s wife, who was sitting beside her husband,
was busily spinning yarn; and when Dobran
had finished speaking, she began to hum a song as
she drew the thread. She had a big bunch of wool
fastened to the end of a stick beside her, and she
drew out some hair from the wool and twisted it
into a thread between her thumb and finger. Then
she tied the end of this to the spindle, which was
a pointed stick loaded about the middle with a ball
of dried clay, and started twirling it round with her
other hand. As the spindle went spinning round in
the air, and dropping towards the ground, it drew
the thread out longer, twisting it all the time. As
soon as the spindle reached the ground, Dobran’s
wife picked it up, wound the thread round it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
set it spinning again; and so she went on until she
had spun a good ball of yarn.</p>

<p>Outside the hut a daughter of Dobran’s, whose
name was Eira, was sitting at the loom weaving
cloth. Her loom was an upright wooden frame, and
the main threads, called the warp, were stretched
from the top of the loom to the bottom and kept
taut by means of stone weights. In her hand Eira
held a shuttle containing the cross-thread, called
the woof, which she passed in and out through the
warp, from side to side of the loom. After she had
worked in five or six cross-lines in this way, and so
had got a narrow piece of cloth woven, she stopped
and picked up a thin, flat piece of wood, cut into teeth
like a comb, and combed the web and pressed it
down firmly. Her thread was finer and her cloth
better than the women made in Tig’s village, and
he stood and watched her. “Aye,” said Dobran,
“she is a famous weaver. She shall give thee a girdle
of her own weaving. Nay, now, she shall weave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>thee a shirt of three colours, and thou shalt come
again and fetch it for thyself.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Weaving at the Loom</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>On the next morning Tig rose early, and found
that Dobran’s people were already astir. Eira and
another girl were grinding corn on a big, flat rubbing
stone; and afterwards Eira took the meal that
they had ground to make cakes for breakfast.</p>

<p>Then, after they had eaten the morning meal,
Tig bade farewell to his friends, the Lake People,
and set off homeward. Some of the men paddled
him ashore in a canoe, and guided him through
the woods and set him on the way; and he returned
to his father’s camp.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHEN Uncle John had finished
reading, he asked the boys if they
had ever heard before of people
living in houses with water all
round as a defence against their
enemies?</p>

<p>“Yes, if you mean a single house,” Dick said,
“you told me that your house here once had a moat
all round it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle John, “so it had; and though
the village of the Lake People was built many
hundreds of years before ever there was a house
like mine in all the country, yet the notion was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
same. In the old days men felt safer with deep
water all round them, than when there was only a
stockade, or even a wall. The villages by the lakes
in Switzerland that I told you of before, were built
in that way over the water on piles.”</p>

<p>David wanted to know how the Lake People
had managed to support the platform on which the
huts were built&mdash;was it held up by straight piles,
like a table with a lot of legs?</p>

<p>“No,” said Uncle John, “not in Dobran’s village,
anyway. I will tell you what I know about it.
Some time ago a farmer who lives near here had a
boggy place on his farm. It lay in a hollow among
his fields, and in winter or after a great deal of rain
it became almost a lake. People used to say that
once upon a time there had been a lake there, but
it had got filled up with moss and peat. However,
the farmer wanted to turn it into ploughing-land,
so he set to work to drain it; his men dug drains
and ran off all the water, and then they saw a large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
low mound standing up out of the mud. And when
they came to clear the mound away, they found
that it was the remains of an ancient lake village
that had lain hidden in the bog under the water for
hundreds of years. I heard about it, so I went, and
stayed all the time, day after day, while they were
digging out the remains; and so I got a good notion
of how those old people, that we have been reading
about, used to make their lake-villages in this part
of the country&mdash;for in other places they had other
ways.”</p>

<p>“What did you find?” the boys all asked.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t find any huts; they had all
gone to decay long before; but the great platform
of tree-trunks was there, and its foundations and
parts of what had been the gangway to the shore.
And we found the old rubbish-heap, and we picked
over and sifted every bit of it; and I will show you
an arrow-head and some beads, and some pieces of
pottery, that I picked out of the rubbish myself. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
this rubbish were great numbers of bones of animals
that the people had used for food. The bones
were of deer and cattle and sheep and some of
smaller animals, and some of birds. But the greatest
find of all was a canoe. We found it lying buried in
the mud, wonderfully preserved. We could see that
it had been made, like Robinson Crusoe’s boat, out
of the trunk of a tree, and hollowed out by fire, and
hewn with stone axes.</p>

<p>“And the mound was cleared away from top to
bottom, and very hard work this was; for it was
solidly built of tree-trunks laid in rows like the
sheaves in a corn-stack: there were hundreds of
trees, though none of them very large. Then there
were piles driven in upright to hold the others together,
and great stones that had been sunk to keep
the beams down: and at the bottom of all were
bundles of brushwood and more large stones, which
had been put down first for the foundations. And if
you bear in mind that the people of the lake-village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had had to chop down all those trees and lop off
the branches with their stone axes, which, as Joe
reminded us, were not the best sort of cutting tools,
and bring every faggot and every stone and every
beam across the water in their canoes, you will see
it must have been a great piece of work for them.
The farmer and his men had a stiff job to pull the
mound to pieces and clear it away; but these old
people, we may be sure, had a much harder task in
building it.”</p>

<p>Joe said that, perhaps, they floated out the tree-trunks
on the water&mdash;that would be easier than
putting them on the canoes.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Uncle John. “When they
had got the foundation of stones and faggots laid,
they made rafts of the trees and towed them out and
loaded them up with stones and so sank them upon
the foundations; and then laid more trunks on
these, until they got to the right height above the
water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you find any other things in the rubbish
heap?” David asked.</p>

<p>“We found some bone harpoons for spearing
fish, and a number of objects of stone, such as
weights for sinking fishing nets, and some that
were used, perhaps, as whorls for twisting thread
in spinning, and some beads of jet and a number
of bone needles; but not many arrows, and only
two or three axe-heads, one of which was broken.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you find more weapons?” David
asked; “I expect the people had many more, hadn’t
they?”</p>

<p>“I expect they had,” said Uncle John, “but
I’m afraid I can’t tell you why no more were found.
Perhaps the people went away to live somewhere
else and took their belongings with them.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had been there when you were
digging at the mound,” Dick said. “I suppose
there isn’t another one anywhere about?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Uncle John. “I’m afraid there isn’t
another one.”</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>THE STORY OF TIG: How the Old Chief Died</i></p>

<div style="width: 147px">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-n.png" width="149" height="150" alt="decorative letter N" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">NOW it happened, when they all
came home again from the hunting
camp, that the old chief of the
village fell ill. Caerig was his name,
but the people always called him
Old Chief, for he had been the head man of the village
for many years, and they all honoured him
because he had been a clever hunter in the past
days and a brave fighter.</p>

<p>The women of the village attended to him in his
sickness, and tried to cure him with the medicines
made from wild plants which they gathered in the
woods; but the medicines did no good, and Old
Chief grew worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then at last two sons of the old chief went a
journey to a village some distance away where a
Medicine Man lived, and they took presents to the
Medicine Man and begged him to come to cure
the old chief’s sickness: and the Medicine Man
came. He was a very old man, and he had a great
name for skill in curing diseases. He brought with
him his wand of magic wood and a bone rattle, but
no medicines, though it was said of him that he
could make more powerful medicines than any that
the women made. He went into the old chief’s hut,
and sat by him for a long time without speaking.
Then he got up and walked solemnly round the bed
from left to right three times, making signs with
his wand and shaking his rattle. Tig and some of
the others were waiting and listening outside the
hut, and only the old chief’s sons and some of the
older men were allowed inside. Then the Medicine
Man said that an evil spirit was troubling Old
Chief, and unless he could scare it away, the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
would die. The Medicine Man began to chant a
song, shaking his rattle and beating on the ground
with his wand; and the old chief lay groaning in
pain, and the people cried and groaned also. At
last the Medicine Man said that no more could be
done that night; but that on the morrow he would
work a stronger spell against the evil spirit. But in
the night Old Chief died.</p>

<p>Then in the morning the news spread about that
the old chief was dead; and the women who had
attended him in his sickness stood around the hut
moaning and wailing, and went crying up and down
the village. And all the people mourned for him.
Then after two days they carried his body to the
top of a hill beyond the village, and built a funeral
pyre of faggots and burned his body in the fire.
This was done according to the rule of the Medicine
Men, of whom there were three present to
take part in the funeral. They gathered the ashes
together and put them into an urn and then carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the urn to a place that they had chosen. In the
meantime the people had built up another great
fire; and they brought an ox, and killed it and
roasted it in the fire, and made a great feast on the
hill-top beside the fire, and all the people sat down
and feasted at the funeral feast of the old chief.
Then the Medicine Men bade the people approach
to lay the gifts in the grave. They brought food
from the feast and set it in little vessels beside the
urn, because they believed that the chief’s spirit
would need food for refreshment in the spirit
world; and they brought his spear and his axe and
his bow and arrows and his shield, and laid them in
the grave; and they brought his favourite dog and
killed it there, and laid its body beside the urn, so
that it might attend its master in the world of spirits.
Then when this was done, the Medicine Men made
the people bring stones to raise a cairn over the
urn. First they laid large flat stones, building them
like a little chamber about the urn; then they laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
six large blocks in a circle all round, and set others
within the circle and piled them up into a great
heap. These stones they brought from the river
bed in the valley and carried them up across the
hill-side to build the cairn. The building of the
cairn was a work of several days; and every day
until the work was finished, the women mourned
and wailed in the village at sunset.</p>

<p>At last, on the day that the cairn was finished,
the men of the village met together in council to
choose one to be chief in the place of Caerig.
Then Arsan, the old man, stood up and said:</p>

<p>“Garff is the man among us who is fittest to be our
chief; for he is an able man and skilful, whether
for hunting or for battle; and he is a man wise in
council and the master of many cattle. Shall we not
do well to choose him to be our chief?”</p>

<p>And the men said, “We shall do well.”</p>

<p>Then Garff stood up and said, “It is too much
honour that you do me, friends, for I am a plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
man and little skilled in speaking. But if you
choose me to be your leader, I will strive to do my
best for the good of all, whether in the hunt or in
battle.”</p>

<p>So they chose Garff to be chief, and from that
day he was the head man among the people and
took the chief place at the councils. And when any
strangers from other villages came with messages,
they were taken to Garff’s hut to deliver their message
and to seek his protection.</p>

<p class="drop-capi4">AFTER his first visit to the Lake
Village Tig went sometimes to see
his friends there, always taking
care to carry with him a present
of game of his own killing, a hare
or some birds, for Eira and her mother; for he was
glad that they should see what a clever hunter he
was; and Eira showed him how well she could cook
the meat that he brought, and was pleased when he
praised her cookery. Dobran and Gaithel took him
out fishing, but Tig did not care much for this. However,
one day they promised to show him better
sport, for a party was going up into their hunting-grounds
to hunt deer in a manner of their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>They all started very early in the morning and
marched up into the hills. Then the men spread their
party out into a long line, curved like the letter C,
and swept across the hill-side with their dogs. Then
they closed in, and beat the woods until the hunters
on one side started a herd of deer. The deer dashed
across the woodland valley and tried to escape on
the other side, but the men of the further line turned
them back and drove them into the woods
again.</p>

<p>So the hunters kept the deer moving forward,
always within the line, until they drove them to a
narrow place near the end of the valley, where there
was a big trap, a high double fence among the trees,
made in the shape of a long V. The hunters closed
in on the deer and drove them in at the broad open
end of the fence, and then drove them on and on
until the deer were enclosed in the narrow end,
where the ground was soft and boggy, so that they
could not leap out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Then some of the hunters climbed over the
fence, and speared or clubbed the poor animals
that were standing up to their knees in the
soft soil, panting and terror-stricken. In this
manner in one day the hunters got eleven head
of deer; but Tig thought it was not such fine
sport as stalking a stag on the hills, though at
the time of the drive, when they were heading
the deer down through the woods, it was exciting
work.</p>

<p>Then they carried home the deer that they
had killed, and they all spent two or three days in
feasting.</p>

<p>Another day when Tig and Gaithel were in the
woods, they came to a valley where a stream flowed
quietly along and the trees grew on the banks near
the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“This is the beavers’ valley,” said Gaithel,
“they have their village here. They are our brothers,
for they build their houses beside the water even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as we do; but we hunt them and kill them although
we do call them our brothers.”</p>

<p>The beavers’ home was in a pond. They had
made the pond by laying a dam of logs across the
stream to hold back the water; and there they had
built their huts with round tops of interlaced
branches that showed above the water. Tig saw
where they had cut down many tall trees on the
banks and gnawed them into logs with their strong
teeth.</p>

<p>“Do you set traps for the beavers?” Tig
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, we trap them; we bait the traps with
fresh wood&mdash;fresh sweet bark is what they like.
Sometimes we hunt them in the winter, when their
ponds are frozen over. We go and batter at the
huts with clubs. Then the beavers rush out of their
huts under the ice and make for holes that they
have in the banks; but we try to head them off
from these by banging on the ice, and make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
come up to breathe at holes in the ice. They must
come up after a time to get breath. Then we stand
at the holes and try to spear them. We often scatter
dry husks over the holes: the stuff floats on the
water, and then the beavers cannot see us waiting
by the holes, and we catch them if we are quick.”</p>

<p>“Have you many beavers about here?” Tig
asked.</p>

<p>“There are not so many as there were once.
My grandfather can remember when there used
to be nine or ten beavers’ dams in these valleys
where there are only three or four now.”</p>

<p>“They are getting scarce in our woods too,”
said Tig, “we have hunted them so much.”</p>

<p>The next day Tig went home to his own village
and got some of his neighbours to help him
build a new hut and bring into it the necessary
things. Then he went again to the Lake Village,
taking presents for Eira’s father and mother, and
he asked Eira to be his wife. Then they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
married according to the custom of her people,
and there was a great feast at the wedding, and the
men ran races, and they all danced many dances.
And afterwards Tig took Eira home to the new
hut in his own village.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHEN the boys went out after this
reading, they got their bows and
arrows. By this time the bows
were finished. Dick had given to
each of the others two arrows out
of his set that came from London. These were
well made with blunt metal heads fitting like caps.
Besides these Joe had made himself six arrows,
and the other two four each. For heads they had
nails, filed down flat on two sides to make them
fit into the shaft, and sharpened at the point. The
great difficulty had been to get straight sticks, and
though they agreed that it was not a real hunter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
way of doing it, they had cut lengths from a thin
piece of hard-wood board, with a fine saw, and
then trimmed and sand-papered these to make them
round and smooth. To fix in the heads they made
a cut, deep enough to take the nail, and then
wrapped it with fine string and glued this well
over. When they had fixed the feathers, the arrows
were complete, and each marked his own. Dick
had a V for his mark, Joe a cut between two dots,
and David a dot between two cuts. The gardener
made them a target out of bands of straw, and
they practised at it a good deal. But one day
they made up their minds to try to shoot something
that might be called “game,” and they
went off to the heath. Each took a different way,
but they agreed to meet at the hut afterwards,
with whatever they should have bagged.</p>

<p>Joe went off to a place near the edge of the
wood, where there were generally rabbits playing
about, and his plan was to creep up near enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to get a shot at once, if he could do so without
scaring them, but if not, to hide among the bushes
and wait for them coming out of their burrows.</p>

<p>David crept through the furze looking out for
birds. He saw an old blackbird hopping about
under the bushes, and he shot at it; but it flew
away with a great deal of noise, as if laughing at
David, who had to spend a long time getting back
his arrow from among a lot of prickly brambles.
There were numbers of yellow-hammers perching
about on the furze bushes and crying out: <i>A very,
very little bit of bread and no chee-e-e-ese</i>, and a pair
of bold little stone-chats that kept flying round
calling <i>a-tick, a-tick</i>, but David did not want to
shoot at them. Then a family of green woodpeckers,
father and mother and four young ones,
came flying across from the woods; and David
was so keen on watching them that he forgot he
was a hunter; so when he got to the hut he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
empty-handed. He was the first in, but after a
while Joe came, and he also had got nothing.</p>

<p>“I nearly shot a starling,” he said; “there was
a flock of them running about on the grass, and I
shot right into the middle of them. I wish I had
got one, for it says in that book of mine that a
starling is the best bird to get when you are
learning to stuff, as it is easy to skin&mdash;I say, it
would be fun to shoot a rabbit and skin it, and
try to cure the skin!”</p>

<p>Just then Dick came in. He had his pockets
stuffed out, and the others wanted to know what
he had got. He said they were to make a fire and
then he would show them; so they went out and
collected sticks and made a fire in the fireplace
outside the hut. Then Dick brought out of his
pocket six potatoes, and said that was all his
game. “I never saw anything to shoot at,” he
said, “but the men in a field over there are
taking up potatoes and they gave me these for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
twopence, and would have let me have more if
I could have stowed them away. I thought we
could roast them in the ashes.”</p>

<p>But Dick had something else to show. He had
found some pieces of wool, torn off sheep’s fleeces,
hanging to the thorn bushes on the heath, and had
gathered them all up.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall go and try to get some
more,” he said, “and when I have got enough,
I shall make a spindle, if I can find out exactly
what it ought to be like, and see if I can spin
some yarn: and if I can spin the yarn, I shall
rig up a loom and have a try at weaving a piece
of cloth. There isn’t much chance of being able
to do it right, of course, but it is good fun trying.”</p>

brought Tidings of War</i></p>

<div class="width153">
<img class="drop-capi" src="images/i_dec-o.png" width="153" height="150" alt="decorative letter O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">ONE day when Tig was sitting at
the door of his hut trimming
sticks for arrows, he heard the
dogs barking, so he went to the
gate and looked out. He saw three
men coming up the hill, and when they came
nearer he saw that they were some of the Lake
Village people, friends of his. He went out to
meet them, and brought them into the village and
took them to his father’s hut, because they said
they had brought an important message.</p>

<p>But first, Gofa and some of the other women
brought food and set it before the visitors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
they ate and drank. Then when Garff had called
together the elder men of the village, he asked
the leader of the party to give his message.</p>

<p>Then the man, whose name was Dileas, stood
up and said:</p>

<p>“For many months past, O chief, our folk have
been sorely molested by the people that dwell to
the southward of our borders, across the waters
of the big river. Their men have trespassed upon
our hunting-grounds, and when we have resisted
them, they have fought and several of our men
have been slain. And now of late they have taken
to hunting openly upon our side of the water,
coming up the river in their canoes, in bands, and
daring us to drive them back.</p>

<p>“Yet have we worse than this to tell. For nine
days ago a party of their men attacked our cowherds,
who were tending the cattle on the hill-side;
and they drove off the cattle and slew one of the
cowherds that was an old man, and carried off two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
young men to their village. But a young man who
escaped, being a swift runner, fled home and
brought us these tidings. And on the next day our
chief sent me and these two, my companions, to
the people across the big river, to make complaint
of the matter. And we saw their chief, sitting
with the old men of the tribe; and we spoke
civilly to them, saying that doubtless the wrong
was done by some of their young men that were
headstrong and perhaps ignorant; and that if they
would restore our cattle and release our brothers
and make payment for the death of the other,
and would swear by their gods to trouble us no
more, then we would not seek vengeance for blood,
but would be at peace with them and keep faith.</p>

<p>“But they gave us only harsh words, saying that
our cowherds had fallen first upon their men, who
were but seeking for some of their beasts that had
strayed; that as for the cattle, they had taken them
in fair fight and should keep them; and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
brothers they should keep also to be slaves to
them. And their chief boasted and said that his
people are called the Warriors, and that warriors
they be; that they are mightier than we, and are
able to drive us into the hills and take away all our
cattle, and take also our women and our young
men to be their slaves. And their chief showed us
his axe, the like of which we have never seen, for
it was yellow and shining and of very great sharpness,
and he said that with this axe he hath slain
above threescore men. Then he sent us away, and
we departed and came to our own village again,
and brought these woeful tidings to our people.</p>

<p>“And yet worse remains still to be told. For
we have deemed it prudent to send out spies to
watch their village, and our spies have brought
us word that the Warriors are going about their
streets painted and arrayed for battle, and that the
Medicine Men are making daily sacrifices to their
gods, that their people may prosper in battle; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
by these things we are assured that they will soon
make war on us.</p>

<p>“And now, O Chief, we are come to seek help
from you and your people; and we pray you to
aid us to fight against the Warriors and drive
them back across the water, lest they, having
conquered us and burned our village, fall next
upon your people and do the like to you.”</p>

<p>Then Garff looked round upon the elder men
and said:</p>

<p>“Shall we not do amiss if we withhold help
from these our friends in their need? Let us join
our arms to theirs and fight side by side with them
against the men who are their enemies and ours.”</p>

<p>And the men all said, “Yes, we will fight.”</p>

<p>Then Garff made an agreement with the Lake
Men that they should return at once to their village,
and set spies to watch the fords of the river
and the village of the Warriors; and if an army
should be seen to leave the village, then the Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
People were to light three beacon fires upon the
top of the hill above their village, and he and his
men would come to their aid.</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">

<div class="caption"><p>The Beacon</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>And Garff sent Tig, with seven young men, to
make a camp on the hills within sight of the Lake
People’s hill, that they might watch by day and
night for the signal. Then the three Lake Men
departed and went back to their village.</p>

<p>So Tig and his companions packed their stores
and took their arms, their best bows and all their
war-arrows and their shields of wickerwork covered
with hide; and pitched their camp up in the hills.
They watched the hill, day and night, for the alarm-fire;
and meantime they prepared themselves for
battle, dyeing and painting their bodies with red
paint and blue paint; also they exercised themselves
in war-games and dances.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the third day the men
on the look-out saw three columns of smoke rising
from the top of the hill far off. So Tig sent two of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>the young men who were swift runners to carry
the news to Garff, and he sent Eira, and the other
women who had been with them, home also; and
he and his five companions set off to go to the
Lake Village.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">WHEN Garff and his men reached
the Lake Village, they found the
people armed and ready. The Chief
of the Lake People, whose name
was Bran, came out to meet Garff,
and he called him and some of his men into the
council that they might make a plan of war. And
he told Garff that his spies had seen the army of
the Warriors muster at daybreak on the river bank.
They had crossed in canoes, and had built a stockade
on this side of the water, and dragged the canoes
ashore. They had been seen fixing long poles to the
canoes, which were light ones made of wicker and
hide; and it was thought that they meant to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
some of the canoes over the hills to the lake, so
that one band of their men might attack the island
from the canoes, while another band should try to
force the gangway.</p>

<p>Then one of the old men stood up and said:</p>

<p>“Surely this will be their plan! But how can we
meet them better than here on our island, where
the water and our good wall are our defence? Our
fathers met their foes thus and beat them back.
What is this talk that I hear of going forth to
battle in the woods? If we leave our defences, we
are lost.”</p>

<p>Then Bran said that it was the wish of some
of the younger men to march out and try to take
their enemies by surprise in the woods, and that
he himself was in favour of this plan.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Garff, “that is the right plan.
If you had meant to stay at home and fight
behind walls, you had not needed help from us;
and we, too, might have taken our folks and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cattle and shut ourselves up in our hill-fort. No,
leave some of your older men that can yet bear
arms to stay by the village and defend it if need
be. But let the rest of us go out and fall upon these
Warriors suddenly in the woods; and let some of
the young men go and watch the fords, to see that
none of the enemy cross the river elsewhere
and take us in the rear; but let us start without
delay.”</p>

<p>So they marched at once; and since Bran was
an old man and less skilled in warfare than Garff,
he gave the command of all the men to him, and
he himself marched behind.</p>

<p>When they had gone some distance through the
forest, and had come to an open place upon the
hill-side, Garff made the men halt and hide themselves
in a thicket at the edge of the wood; and
he sent Tig with two others to spy for the advance
of the enemy. Tig and his companions crept away
through the bushes and were gone for some time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
At length they came back swiftly and cautiously,
with news that they had seen a large band of the
enemy in the wood below, all fully armed with
bows and slings, and spears and axes and clubs, and
carrying four canoes in their rear. So Garff set all
his men in battle-line, and bade them lie still until
the enemy should be well out into the open ground.
Then, at a signal, they were to leap up suddenly
and shoot a flight of arrows and rush upon the
Warriors, every one marking his man.</p>

<p>Presently they heard voices and saw the figures
of the leaders appear among the trees. The Warriors
were sure of victory, and they had no thought
of the Lake Men coming out to meet them; so
they were marching carelessly along, thinking more
of getting their canoes up the hill than of preparing
to fight. They streamed out into the open,
led by their chief who was carrying his axe on
his shoulder. Garff waited till the band were well
away from the shelter of the trees, and then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
sprang to his feet with a great shout. At once his
men leaped up, and sent a deadly shower of arrows
at the enemy; and every man, as soon as he had
shot, fitted another arrow and shot again. Many
of the Warriors fell, and many were wounded,
and they were thrown into great confusion. But
their chief rushed down their ranks shouting to
them not to give way, but to take their shields
and advance. Then to gain time and to save his
broken line, he dashed forward alone, holding up
his arm. Garff signed to his men to cease shooting,
and the chief of the Warriors came on shouting:</p>

<p>“Let one of you fight with me! If there be a
man among you, let him come forth and fight
with me!”</p>

<p>Then Garff strode out from among his men
and went forward to meet the chief, who stood
brandishing his axe, which glittered as he waved
it in the sunlight. And the chief cried out:</p>

<div class="illus"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="474" height="700" alt="man holding an axe" />
<div class="caption"><p>The Warrior Chief</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>“Ho! Ho! This is my axe! Skull-pecker is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>name, for he has pecked open many a skull&mdash;ay,
and split them in twain and eaten up the brains.
Come on, come on! He will split thy skull even
as the others, and slice thy flesh and chop up thy
bones. Come on, come on!”</p>

<p>But when the chief saw Garff coming out to
meet him, he stopped his boasting, for he saw
that he had met as tough a fighter as himself.</p>

<p>Each man had thrown down his shield and each
grasped his axe with both hands. Garff’s weapon
was a battle-axe of stone, heavy and strong, but not
so keen as the bronze axe of his enemy and not so
deadly, unless he could get in a sweeping blow.
The chief of the Warriors was taller than Garff,
but not stronger, though Garff had the longer
arms and was the more active of the two; also the
chief had been wounded in the thigh by an arrow,
and although he had tugged it out, he could not
stop the flow of blood.</p>

<p>For a few seconds they faced one another without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
moving, and then the chief made a sudden
leap forward and aimed a tremendous blow at
Garff’s head. Garff leaped back to avoid the blow,
and then rushed in and aimed a return stroke as
his enemy’s axe swung round, and the chief leaped
back. So they went on, striking and avoiding
warily, until Garff began to give way, leaping
backward at each attack and not striking again in
return, for he saw that his enemy was spending his
strength, and he meant to save his own. Never
for a second did Garff cease to fix his eyes on his
enemy’s eyes, and the two faced each other
savagely. Then the chief rushed at Garff again in
a fury, and struck with all his might. Garff avoided
again, and jabbed upward with his axe-head to
parry the blow, but he was not quick enough, and
got a deep cut in the arm. Then the chief pressed
hard upon him, thinking to end him with one
blow; but Garff parried the stroke and gave a
mighty spring, and before his enemy could recover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
dealt him a blow on the right shoulder, so that
he dropped his axe and fell prone. Then Garff
picked up the bronze axe of the chief and drove
it deep into his skull, then waved his own axe
over his head and gave a great shout.</p>

<p>When the Warriors saw their leader fall, they
uttered loud cries, and some of them rushed forward
with spears and axes. But Tig leaped out, and
Garff’s men and the Lake Men with him, and
Garff waved the dripping axe, and they rushed
upon the band and put them to flight and chased
them through the woods, every one marking his
man. And they killed many of them there and
many by the river-side, and only those escaped who
flung themselves into the river and swam across.</p>

<p>Then Garff and Bran called their men together,
and they found that only five had been killed in
the fight and seven wounded. And they sought
out the bodies of their enemies that were fallen,
and took their weapons and their necklaces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
cut off their heads; and Garff cut off the head of
the chief, and took his necklace of amber and his
famous bronze axe, Skull-pecker; and so they all
marched back in triumph, carrying their spoils
and the heads of their enemies, to their own villages.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">I AM afraid,” said Uncle John,
when the chapter was finished,
“that we shall not be able to
have any more reading these
holidays; for to-morrow and the
next day I shall be away from home. There is
one day left after that, as you know, but instead
of the story I have planned an outing for us, which
I have been trying to arrange ever since we read
about the burial of the Old Chief. My plan is this.
Up on the moor, beyond the place where we found
the pit-dwellings, there is a barrow, as it is called,
the burial mound of one of the old chiefs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
time that we have been reading about. The owner
of the land, who is a friend of mine, intends to
open the barrow; the work is to be begun to-morrow,
and he has invited us to go and see what there
is to be seen.”</p>

<p>So on the next day they all set off to the moor
with a big hamper of provisions and a tea-kettle
and a spade each. There were several mounds and
barrows on the high parts of the moor, and in one
place there were three huge standing stones marking
what had once been a whole circle of stones.</p>

<p>They walked over the moor until they found
the squire and his men. The men were already at
work with picks and shovels, and had made a deep
cutting in the side of the barrow. At first they
had dug through a quantity of the heathery soil
and gravel, but after a while they came to large
stones; and digging these out and carrying them
back out of the way was very hard work.</p>

<p>Uncle John rolled one aside and said to the boys:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can any of you find me another stone like
this one anywhere on the moor round about?”</p>

<p>They looked at the stone, which was a smooth
rounded boulder, and then searched the ground
round about. But the only stones that were there
were small and rough. “This one came from the
bed of the stream down below there,” said Uncle
John, “don’t you see it is water-worn. The men
who built this barrow carried that stone and
these others like it all the way up here on their
shoulders.”</p>

<p>After they had had lunch, the work was begun
again, the men pulling out the big stones one after
another. At last they came to where several large
flat stones were set on edge, leaning one against
another. These were pulled away, and then there
was discovered a little chamber right in the centre
of the barrow, walled in with flat stones; and in
the midst of this little chamber a large urn of
baked earthenware. Before anything was moved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Uncle John brought the boys to look, and showed
them how the floor of the little chamber had been
strewn with fine white sand upon which the urn
was set. Beside it were three smaller vessels all
empty, and lying beside them were two flint
arrow-heads, a small stone axe, and a hammer
made out of the thick end of a red deer’s antler
bored with a hole to fit a handle into. Uncle
John lifted the urn carefully out and they all
looked inside it. It was full of dust and ashes,
and some bits of charred bone, and some chips
and splinters of flint that had also been burned.
These relics were all gathered carefully together
to be taken to the squire’s house, and the workmen
began to put away their tools.</p>

<p>As Uncle John and the boys walked home,
Dick asked: “Did those people burn every one
who died?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not every one, but they did it very
often.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why did they?”</p>

<p>“That is a hard question for me to answer&mdash;it
was part of their religion, I suppose; anyway
perhaps they thought it the safest thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Did they always kill a man’s dog, too?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know. In many cases no doubt
they did, because dog’s bones have been found in
the barrows; sometimes horses’ bones have been
found too, showing that people thought their
horses could follow them to the spirit-world, and
sometimes, it is thought, that a man’s slaves and
even his wife were taken to the grave and
killed, so that their spirits might attend his after
death.”</p>

<p>“How did they bore the holes in their axes and
things?” David asked. “The hole in that hammer
was as smooth as if it had been drilled.”</p>

<p>“I daresay it was drilled,” said Uncle John.
“Not with a flint tool, perhaps, but most likely
with quite a different thing&mdash;a hollow stick, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tube, with the boring end wetted and dipped in
sand. With a tool of that sort you can bore a hole
in any stone, if you keep on at it long enough, just
as you can fine down wood or metal with sandpaper.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you would twirl the stick between
your hands and press hard on the top of it,” said
David. “And if the stone were hard you would
want fine, sharp sand,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Is there any more about Tig in the book?” Joe
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe there is more&mdash;he lived to be a
very old man and became Chief in his time, and to
him Garff bequeathed the wonderful bronze axe,
Skull-pecker. He had much fighting to do; but he
beat back his enemies and kept his people’s
hunting-grounds and their cattle safe, as long as
he lived.”</p>

<p>On the evening of the last day of the holidays
Uncle John took the boys into his study and opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the drawer in the cabinet where his arrow-heads
were.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “I want each of you to choose
a flint out of this lot, and keep it as a reminder of
what we have been reading about. Each one can
have his pick in turn&mdash;Dick first, because he was
here first, and Joe next and then David, as that is
the order in which we met one another.” There
were plenty to choose from, and they each chose
one of the barbed war-arrows. Then Uncle John
said:</p>

<p>“When I was a boy I used to know an old gentleman
who had a flint arrow-head, and I used to wish
he would give it to me. But no&mdash;he set great store
by it and wore it on his watch-chain, mounted as
a charm. He called it a fairy-bolt, because he said
that it had been made and shot away by the fairies;
and he thought it would bring him good luck all
his life. I hope you are all pleased with your flints;
and though, perhaps, they can’t bring you any good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
luck, at any rate you have learned something about
them, and about the people who made and used
them long ago, in this same country in which we
live and now call England.”</p>
